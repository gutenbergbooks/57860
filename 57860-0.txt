                             INTRODUCTION.


Conchology or Testaceology is a numerous and beautiful branch of Natural
History, treating of the testaceous covering of animals; perhaps none
but the department of Flora can vie with it in variety, symmetry of
form, and rich colouring. It has ever excited admiration, and obtained a
prominent situation in the cabinet; and so great are the facilities
afforded at the present day to procure specimens and obtain a knowledge
of this science, that it has become one of the requisites of a finished
education. Shells are found in all parts of the world, both on land and
in water; but the most beautiful and valuable species are found between
the tropics.

At first they were regarded as pleasing curiosities, and prized only on
that account; but the investigations of scientific men have proved that
the study of this science is not only interesting, but useful. Much
valuable information has already been obtained, and, from the
investigations of modern naturalists, much more may be anticipated.

So intimate is the connexion between Conchology and Geology, that a
knowledge of the one is indispensable to the study and acquirement of
the other. The geologist will draw much advantage from a close study of
the testaceous covering of molluscous animals to aid him in determining
the identity or the superposition of the different strata of the earth
and the extraordinary changes it has undergone; for, as Bergman
elegantly says, “fossil shells, coral, and wood are the only three
remaining medals of Creation.” He will see in the innumerable quantity
of these animals, succeeding each other from generation to generation in
the depth of the seas, one of the evident causes of the growth and
increase of islands and continents.

But man may find in the knowledge of Mollusca applications still more
direct to his well being in society, both as to the advantages and
disadvantages to be derived from them: thus a great number of species
are proper for food, as oysters, mussels, &c., which are objects of
commercial speculations. The Pinna furnishes the Italians with materials
for a rich dress, and the pearl, so much prized by the Orientals, by
princes, and particularly by the ladies, as a modest and beautiful
ornament, is produced by a disease of the animals in certain species of
shells. It was this knowledge which made the celebrated Linnæus imagine
that it was possible to form an artificial pearlery in the rivers of
Sweden. The mother of pearl, so much employed as an ornament in articles
of luxury, is only the interior lining of certain univalve or bivalve
shells. Painting draws from some of these animals many colours, valuable
not so much for their beauty as their usefulness, as Chinese ink and
sepia.

The brightest and richest colour known by the ancients, and used by them
for the celebrated Tyrian purple dye, is produced by animals at this
time known by the name of Purpura.

The Teredo attacks the wood of our vessels, and often does much injury;
therefore the knowledge of its manners, habits, and customs must be of
great importance in countries infested with them, so as to be able to
provide a remedy against them. Snails and slugs are also enemies much to
be dreaded in our gardens.

Lamarck, in his last work, the result of the successive and continual
labours of his whole life and those of his contemporaries, has rendered
a very great service to science, but especially to conchology, by
describing, or, at least, characterizing the numerous species of shells
in his own splendid cabinet. It may be proper here to remark, that a
part of Lamarck’s cabinet is now in the possession of Isaac Lea, Esq.,
of Philadelphia, to whom we are much indebted for valuable assistance.
To Dr. Comstock, and the Rev. W. Turner, of Hartford, Conn., we are much
indebted for kind favours; their aid has greatly facilitated our
labours.

In this Manual of Conchology we have endeavoured to give a free
translation of Lamarck’s system, as simplified by De Blainville; and, in
order to facilitate as much as possible the study of this beautiful and
interesting science, we have divested it of numerous technicalities, and
divided it into four classes: Annelides, Cirrhipedes, Conchifera, and
Mollusca.

To each class we have assigned its various families, to each family its
genera, and to each genus its living species; thereby making it plain
and within the reach of the meanest capacity. A type of almost every
genus is given, excepting only those shells which, from their similarity
to other genera, may easily be classed.

It was deemed advisable, as this is intended for an easy introduction to
the science, to omit many divisions and subdivisions, which would only
serve to perplex and render the attainment more difficult.

As the Naiades, or shells of this country, are given in several valuable
scientific works lately published, we have only slightly touched them in
the place they are intended to occupy.

We cannot expect that the work now presented to the public is free from
imperfections; but we ask for their lenity and kind forbearance to
excuse whatever defects there may be in our humble attempts to advance
the cause of science. Conchology, like other departments of natural
history, is progressing; and that which is given to-day is almost always
susceptible of being modified to-morrow; should this work be well
received, it is our intention to give, as soon as practicable, an
enlarged work, containing even the minute microscopic shells and the
fossils, with plates containing types of as many species of the genera
as can possibly be obtained.

The plates were drawn and coloured with great care and accuracy from the
natural shells in our own cabinet, under the superintendence of Mr.
James Ackerman, artist.

and fragments of shells.


             2. Dentalium. The Tooth Shell. Twelve species.

This genus took its name from its resemblance to an elephant’s tooth. It
is an attenuated conical tube, slightly bent, and open at both ends.

Shell tubular, regular, symmetrical, lightly curved longitudinally,
conic, attenuated insensibly posteriorly, and open at each extremity by
a round orifice.

                        Dentalium elephantinum.

Species very minutely striated; white or yellowish colour.

_D. pellucidum._ The pellucid Dentalium.

Species narrow and thin; pale topaz colour.

_D. politum._ The ring-striated Tooth Shell.

Species finely pointed, solid, striated annularly; generally rosy or
pink colour.

_D. rectum._ The straight Tooth Shell.

Species entirely straight, with longitudinal ribs.

_D. eburneum._ The Ivory Tooth Shell.

Species of a reddish or pale yellow colour, with the tip frequently
tinged with orange or pink.


                              FAMILY III.
                       AMPHITRITÆA. Four genera.

The similarity of the four genera comprising this family is such, that
it was thought sufficient to give only one type (the sabellaria
crassissima), as the student may easily recognise the others.


                      1. Pectinaria. Two species.

A membranous or papyraceous tube, in the form of a reversed cone;
unfixed; exterior covered with sandy adhesions.

                          Pectinaria Belgica.
                          Pectinaria capensis.

_P. Belgica._ The Belgic Pectinaria.

Tube inversely conic, membranous, and covered with sand.


                      2. Sabellaria. Two species.

The covering of the animal belonging to this genus is composed of
fragments and particles of marine substances, adhering to a tubular
membrane; some are detached and others are fixed. The tubes are cellular
at the base, and the orifice expanded.

                        Sabellaria alveolata.
                        Sabellaria crassissima.

Consists of numerous parallel tubes, nearly straight, communicating by
an aperture, forming when in mass the appearance of a honeycomb; it
adheres to rocks in clusters.

_S. crassissima._ The very thick or strong Sabellaria. Pl. 33, fig. 2.

Species incrusted with small stones; sometimes found thick and of a
large size.


                      3. Terebella. Three species.

Tube elongated, cylindrical, membranous, attenuated and pointed at the
base, with adhesions of sand.

                         Terebella conchilega.
                         T. cristata.

spatulous tongue; operculum orbicular, squamose, consisting of from five
to nine testaceous parts or valves, all attached to one side of the
operculum; the middle one dentated at the truncated part of its summit,

A very singular shell, greatly resembling a petrified body, composed of
a testaceous white substance like alabaster. The base is bent into a
short spire, with about four contiguous whorls; the last prolonged and
nearly straight. The animal, as it increases in size, abandons the
spiral part by increasing the tubular part, filling up the part it quits
with calcareous matter, which proves that it advances gradually.

Tube partially involuted, convex in its upper exterior part, the lower
side flattened, platted, carinated, and somewhat angular; the spire
short, helix-formed, and prolonged through the rest of its extent in
nearly a right line; aperture entire, oval, with a sort of sinus or
gutter in the middle line, producing the keel of the shell.

_M. antiquus._ The antiquated Magilus.

Answers to the above description; colour pale yellowish brown,
transversely wrinkled.




                               CLASS II.
                              CIRRHIPEDES.
                          HAS BUT ONE FAMILY.


                        CIRRHIPEDES. Ten genera.

Lamarck divided the Lepas of Linnæus into the various genera which
compose this family. The term lepas is derived from the Greek word
λεπας, a rock, alluding to its custom of adhering to rocks and marine
bodies. The shell often varies in shape, covering, and colouring; it is
generally conical, but sometimes hemispherical; some of the valves are
placed perpendicularly on a base, broad at the lower margin and tapering
towards the summit, which is closed by small horizontal valves forming
the operculum. The number of valves is indefinite, from four to
twenty-four; but all are diversified with striæ, ridges, and grooves.
The striæ are mostly transverse, and the ridges longitudinal.

The valves which compose the operculum or lid vary in shape, and are in
number two, three, four, or more; they are generally attached to a
ligament.

They are seldom, if ever, found detached, but adhere in groups to rocks,
shells, anchors, marine animals, &c. Those that fix themselves to ships
are generally called barnacles; they rapidly increase in size and
number, do great damage, and greatly impede the progress of the vessel.
Some of this family are affixed at the base of the shell to other
substances, and are therefore called sessile; others are attached to a
fleshy peduncle or stem, and are said to be pedunculated. The peduncle
or stem, proceeding from the base of the shell to the substance which
sustains it, is sometimes smooth, fine in texture, and tinged with
bright red or orange; sometimes it is of a dark or brownish colour, with
a texture much coarser and granulated.


                      1. Tubicinella. One species.

Has the form of a cylindrical tube, slightly curved, and open at both
ends; one extremity closed by four trapezoidal valves attached to the
inner margin, the other end closed by a membrane. The annular ribs which
separate the compartments show its progressive growth. Found buried so
deeply in the fat of marine animals, particularly whales, that only the
operculum and the upper part of the tube are visible. Shell rather
elevated, sub-cylindrical, the partitions rather small and indented; the
spaces or compartments almost quadrilateral; the inferior much more
narrow than the others; the apertures equal and circular; the membrane
which closes the superior forming a tube between the four almost equal
valves of the operculum.

_T. balænarum._ The Whale Tubicinella.

Tubular, with transverse ribs, and a ring-shaped margin; operculum
bottle-shaped.


                      2. Coronula. Three species.

Found imbedded in the skin of whales and other marine animals, though
not generally at so great a depth as the Tubicinella. Shell in form a
little variable and without trace of support; the coronary part formed
of six pieces, as in those properly called _Balanus_, but more regularly
disposed in a manner to imitate a kind of crown or tube; spaces
alternately hollowed and saliant; operculum not articulated, composed of
two pairs of small, level, delicate valves, joined at the aperture of
the tube by a considerable membranous part, leaving a passage for the
cirrhous appendages of the animal.

part which forms between them a sort of tube.

_C. diadema._ The Crown Coronula.

More elevated, sub-hexagonal; the spaces almost equal, the hollow parts
larger than the saliant; the superior aperture very large and hexagonal;
the inferior much smaller, of the same form, and communicating in a
round excavation by radiated plates; the operculum bivalve.

_C. quinquevalvis._ The five-valved Coronula. Pl. 4, fig. 3.

                               CLASS III.
                              CONCHIFERA.

                       CONTAINS TWENTY FAMILIES.


                               FAMILY I.
                         TUBICOLA. Six genera.


         1. Aspergillum. The Watering-pot Shell. Four species.

A well-known but rare shell; the larger end closed by a convex disk,
with numerous small perforations, and encircled by a dilated margin of
elegant papyraceous tubes, resembling a beautifully plaited ruff; the
smaller end open. Found in sandy places at low water.

Shell oval, slightly elongated, striated longitudinally,
sub-equilateral; adhering, more or less confounded with the coats of a
rather thick calcareous tube, conic, club-shaped, open at its attenuated
extremity, and terminated at the other by a convex disk pierced by a
great number of sub-tubular, rounded holes, and by a fissure in the
centre.

                          Aspergillum Javanum.
                          A. vaginiferum.
                          A. Novæ Zeylandiæ.
                          A. agglutinans.

_A. Javanum._ The Java Aspergillum. Pl. 33, fig. 3.

Species smooth, in which the circumference of the disk is bordered with
a waved testaceous fringe.

_A. Novæ Zeylandiæ._ The New-Zealand Aspergillum.

Species in which the circumference of the disk is without a fringe.


                      2. Clavagella. One species.

An irregular tube, with branches or projecting tubes at the closed end;
within it is one free or moveable valve, united by a ligament to
another, which is blended with the tube; this distinguishes it from the
Aspergillum. Found in sand and coral.

Shell oval, very slightly elongated, striated longitudinally, slightly
irregular; equivalve, inequilateral; hinge a little variable; ligament
exterior; two well-marked distant muscular impressions; a calcareous
sub-cylindrical tube, more or less completely surrounding the shell, and
terminated before by a single orifice.

_C. aperta._ The open Clavagella.

Tube erect, adhering; aperture waved, entire, expanding, funnel-shaped,
leaving the two valves open or uncovered in all their anterior part;
with an ovate face valve.


                      3. Fistulana. Four species.

Lamarck asserts that the tube and shell of this genus are quite
distinct. It so greatly resembles the Teredo that it is with difficulty
distinguished. It is found in sand, wood, stone, and sometimes shells.

Shell annular or very short, not sharp nor angular anteriorly, but in
other respects much like that of the Teredo.

Tube generally shorter, thicker, more solid, more club-shaped than that
of the Teredo, always closed at its anterior extremity in such a manner
as to contain and entirely hide the shell; the posterior extremity open,
and divided interiorly into two syphons by a partition.

                            Fistulana clava.
                            F. corniformis.
                            F. gregata.

_F. corniformis._ The horn-shaped Fistulana.

Answers to the above description.

_F. gregata._ The gregarious Fistulana.

Sheath or tube doubly club-shaped, congregating; shell angularly
arcuated, with double angulated serrated wings.

_F. Clava._ The Club Fistulana. Pl. 33, fig. 5.

Species with one end clavate, the other incurved, narrower, obtuse, and
perforated in the middle; shell generally flexuous, of a brownish
colour; exterior rough, interior smooth.


                       4. Septaria. One species.

The tube of this genus unquestionably contains a bivalve shell; but, as
no perfect specimen has yet been found, nothing decisive is known
respecting it.

Tube calcareous, thick, conically elongated, more or less flexuous, as
if composed of pieces placed on the ends of each other, or as if
articulated, with a ring or projection more or less marked at the place
of the joints, but without traces of partitions; terminated on one side
by an inflation, oftentimes with some interior partitions, and on the
other by two tubes, distinct and sub-articulated.

_S. arenaria._ The Sand Septaria.

The type of this genus.


                    5. Teredina. Two fossil species.

A genus without a living species, given here to preserve the family
entire, having a shell thick, oval, short, very gaping posteriorly,
equivalve, inequilateral; summits well marked; a spoonlike cavity in
each valve.

Tube or sheath testaceous, cylindrical; anterior end open; posterior end
closed, but exhibiting the two valves of the shell.


                6. Teredo. The Ship Worm. Three species.

This genus derived its name from the faculty it possesses of boring
wood. The T. navalis can penetrate the stoutest oaken planks of a ship’s
sides by means of two valves affixed to the head of the animal. The
effects produced would be much more destructive but from the fact of
their generally perforating the wood in the direction of the grain. Sir
E. Home wrote a very scientific and interesting description of a species
not mentioned by Lamarck, called the T. gigantea, found imbedded in
indurated mud in the Island of Sumatra. It is the largest species known,
some having been seen four or five feet long.

Shell thick, solid, very short or annular, open at both extremities;
equivalve, equilateral, angular and sharp anteriorly, only slightly
touching by the opposite edges; hinge obsolete; a considerable internal
spoonlike cavity; one slightly sensible muscular impression.

Tube more or less distinct from the substance in which the animal lives,
cylindrical, straight or flexuous, closed with age at the oral extremity
so as to envelop the animal and its shell; always open at the other end,
and divided interiorly into two syphons by a middle partition.

Species very thin, cylindrical, and smooth; slightly twisted, white,
finely striated longitudinally.


                               FAMILY II.
                        PHOLADARIA. Two genera.


              1. Pholas. The Stone Piercer. Nine species.

This genus is without any tubular sheath; it derives its name from the
Greek word φωλεω, to hide, alluding to the custom of its inhabitant in
forming cells in rocks, wood, &c.

In form the Pholas is generally oblong, having two large valves opposite
to each other, with a number of smaller ones attached to the back as a
substitute for a hinge. The two large valves never shut close; they are
open at one end, and sometimes at both.

The exterior of the shell is usually of a pure or dusky white, but
sometimes of a brownish cast. In some species the shell is adorned with
beautiful delicate reticulations, like the finest lace; in others the
texture is coarser, like small basket-work. They are found in the
American, Indian, and European seas, each shell in a separate habitation
formed in limestone, sandstone, wood, coral, &c.; often discovered
completely imbedded in the oak planks of ships traversing those seas; as
they advance in growth they enlarge the space within, and leave the
aperture by which they entered of its primitive size.

Shell thin, sub-transparent, finely striated, elongated oval, bivalve,
equivalve, inequilateral; the valves only touching in the middle of
their edges; the summits but little marked, and concealed by a callosity
produced by the expansion of the dorsal lobes of the mantle; near the
hinge are often developed one or more accessory calcareous pieces; an
incurved tooth interior beneath the hinge.

                            Pholas dactylus.
                            P. orientalis.

spiny nodules on the ribs, which run widening and enlarging from the
summit to the margin; colour white or very light brown.

_P. striata._ The striated Pholas. Pl. 3, fig. 5.

Oval, the dorsal callosity leaving the summit free, and extending
towards the anterior and inferior extremity in such a manner that each
valve seems to be formed of three parts, because of an oblique furrow
from the summit to the margin; a tooth running down in the inside from
the summit; one pair of accessory pieces at the posterior extremity of
the shell.

_P. candida._ The white Pholas. Pl. 3, fig. 2.

from the Pholas.

Shell equivalve, somewhat wedge-shaped, with a very large, oval,
oblique, anterior opening between the valves; the posterior extremity
nearly close; hinge linear, marginal, without teeth; two distant
muscular impressions; sometimes with a kind of tube or calcareous
general envelope.

                              FAMILY III.
                        SOLENIDES. Four genera.


                      1. Solen. Eighteen species.

There are many species belonging to this genus differing considerably in
form and appearance. Its name is derived from a Greek word signifying a
pipe or tube. It is a bivalve whose breadth sometimes exceeds its
length; some species have a resemblance to the sheath of a razor or a
knife handle; others are curved like the scabbard of a cimeter.

The Solen is found in the sand of the seashore, which it sometimes
penetrates to the depth of one or two feet. Most of the species are
covered with an epidermis, which renders their colours more or less
obscure. In general they present but little beauty, though some are of a
bright pink colour, and some are beautifully and delicately radiated
with purple and white.

The principal characteristic of this genus is the hinge, which generally
has one subulate tooth, though sometimes two or three.

Shell equivalve, extremely inequilateral, transversely elongated, open
at both ends; the apices very small, and entirely at the commencement of
the dorsal line; one or two teeth in the hinge; ligament external; two
distant muscular impressions; the anterior one very long and narrow, the
posterior one sub-angular.

                               FAMILY IV.
                          MYARIA. Two genera.


           1. Mya. The Trough Shell, or Gaper. Four species.

This term is derived from the Greek word μυω, to close, alluding to the
animal’s custom of closing the valves. The principal characteristic of
the Mya is its gaping at one end; it is likewise distinguished by having
a large spoonlike tooth proceeding from beneath the beak. Its form is
greatly varied, but generally covered with a greenish epidermis, which
may be removed; and the shell, when polished, will display beautiful
prismatic colours. The Mya is found on the seashore or on the banks of
large rivers, partially concealed in the sand and mud.

Shell transverse, inequilateral, surrounded with a thick epidermis;
rather solid; edges thin and sharp; summits but little marked; hinge
dissimilar; one or two large, compressed, spoon-shaped teeth rising
perpendicularly from the plane of the left valve, and fitting into the
entrance of a primary cavity in the right valve; ligament interior,
attaching the tooth and cavity; two distant muscular impressions; the
anterior long and narrow, the posterior rounded; the mantle impression
narrow, with a large sinus or hollow.

                            Mya truncata.
                            M. arenaria.

               2. Anatina. The Duck’s Bill. Ten species.

Shell elongated oval, very thin, fragile, semipellucid; much inflated at
one end like a duck’s bill, whence it derives its common name;
equivalve, very inequilateral; hinge toothless; the anterior side
rounded and much longer than the posterior; ligament interior affixed to
a bony spoonlike process in each valve, and sustained by a lateral plate
running obliquely into the interior of the shell.

                            Anatina laterna.
                            A. truncata.

                        MACTRACEA. Seven genera.


                      1. Lutraria. Eleven species.

This genus was taken from the Mactra, and is perfectly distinct, as it
wants the lateral teeth. It is called Lutricola by De Blainville, from
its lurking in sand or mud at the mouths of large rivers.

Shell inequilateral, orbicular, sub-triangular or transversely oval,
gaping at the extremities; hinge with one cardinal tooth folded in two,
or two teeth, one of which is plain, with an opposite hollow to receive
it; no lateral teeth; ligament interior and fixed in the hollow cavity
of the primary tooth.

                          Lutraria solenoides.
                          L. rugosa.

                          L. plicatella.
                          L. crassiplica.
                          L. complanata.
                          L. candida.

_L. solenoides._ The Solen-like Lutraria.

Species oblong, sub-cylindrical, very gaping, two very strong cardinal
teeth; the spoonlike cavity of the ligament vertical.

_L. compressa._ The compressed Lutraria.

Species oval or orbicular, almost equilateral, very compressed, little
gaping; hinge similar; internal ligament inserted in the pit of a
vertical spoonlike cavity; two distinct tubes, without longitudinal
striæ.

_L. rugosa._ The rugged Lutraria.

Species ovate, closed at both ends; striæ from the summit to the base.

_L. elliptica._ The oval Lutraria.

Oblong oval, nearly smooth, having a few concentric striæ, and some
diagonal striæ at the ends of the valves; colour yellow or greenish
brown; inside white.


         2. Mactra. The Kneading-trough. Thirty-three species.

The name given to this genus was derived from the Greek word μακτρα,
from its resemblance to a trough used for kneading bread.

In all species of this genus a similarity of colouring and form pervades
the whole. In shape they are sub-triangular or oblong, with a smooth,
striated, or transversely-ribbed exterior. In some species the valves
gape at both ends, and in others at the anterior only. The most general
colour is lilac, or white tinged with blue or yellow; some have purple
rays on a brown ground.

A singularity in the form of the hinge of the Mactra distinguishes it
from all other genera. It is of a triangular form, has a bent or angular
compressed tooth on each valve, with a small oblique cavity on each side
to which the ligament is attached. There are also two lateral teeth, one
near the ligament and the other near the primary tooth. These teeth are
thin and fragile; the primary tooth is sometimes indistinct, but the
lateral teeth always exist.

The Mactra is found buried in the sand at a little distance from the
seashore. Shell generally thin and brittle, covered with epidermis, of a
triangular form, transverse, equivalve, inequilateral; beaks prominent;
one compressed, folded, cardinal tooth, with an adjoining pit in each
valve, projecting inward; lateral teeth thin, lamellous, entering,
placed near the hinge; exterior ligament small; an interior ligament
inserted in the cardinal pits; two muscular impressions, united by a
narrow marginal tongue.

                    3. Crassatella. Eleven species.

May be easily known from the Mactra and Lutraria, as the valves, when
closed, fit exactly, and do not gape. It is remarkable that all the
living species contained in this genus only exist in the seas of
Australasia, while at least seven species in a fossil state are found in
France.

Shell inequilateral, sub-orbicular, close, equivalve, sometimes
attenuated at one end; two divergent primary teeth, with a cavity at the
side; lateral teeth obsolete; ligament internal, inserted in the cavity

                        4. Erycina. One species.

The only living species of this genus is found on the sand in
New-Holland, but there are many fossils in France. It is so equivocal in
character that it is difficult to judge of their hinge.

_E. cardioides._ The cardium-shaped Erycina. Pl. 6, fig. 5.

Shell rather longer than high, sub-triangular, regular, equivalve,
inequilateral, rarely gaping; the summits well marked and a little
anteriorly inclined; hinge subsimilar; two unequal cardinal teeth,
converging at the summit, and leaving a pit between them; two lateral
teeth, not distant, lamellous, inserted; ligament interior, fixed in the
cavity between the primary teeth.


                       5. Ungulina. Two species.

This genus is very remarkable for having the pit or cavity divided into
two parts, the one at the end of the other; the ligament is partially
seen from the outside.

                          Ungulina oblonga.
                          Ungulina transversa.

_U. transversa._ The transverse Ungulina.

Shell vertical or longitudinal, rather irregular, not gaping, equivalve,
inequilateral, with summits little marked and decorticated; hinge
dorsal, formed by one short, primary cleft tooth, before an oblong pit,
divided by a small ligament, in which is inserted a sub-interior
ligament; colour yellowish brown.


                       6. Solenimya. Two species.

This genus, which at first sight is confounded with the Solens, differs
from them particularly by the singular disposition of the ligament
placed at the short side of the shell.

                        Solenimya Australis.
                        Solenimya Mediterranea.

_S. Australis._ The Australian Solenimya. Pl. 6, fig. 2.

Shell covered with a thick brownish epidermis, regular, thick, elongated
oval, edges straight and parallel, equally rounded at both extremities;
valves equal, very inequilateral.

Transversely oblong; dark brown, ribbed longitudinally, with imbricated
projecting foliations; inside white.


                    7. Amphidesma. Sixteen species.

This genus was constituted by Lamarck on account of the peculiar
characters which distinguished it from those genera which it most
resembles; particularly in having the valves connected by two ligaments.

Shell generally small, transverse, sub-oval or rounded, occasionally a
little gaping at the sides; hinge with one or two cardinal teeth, and a
narrow cavity for the interior ligament; exterior ligament short.

                               FAMILY VI.
                        CORBULACEA. Two genera.


                       1. Corbula. Nine species.

This genus approximates the Crassatella and Ungulina, but is
distinguished from them by the inequality of the valves and the strong
primary tooth.

or less inequilateral, rounded and enlarged before, attenuated and
prolonged behind; summits well marked, one projecting behind the other;
hinge anomalous, formed by a large, conical, recurved cardinal tooth,
with a cavity at its base for the reception of the tooth of the other
valve; ligament very small; two muscular impressions little distant.

                           Pandora rostrata.
                           Pandora obtusa.

_P. rostrata._ The beaked Pandora. Pl. 6, fig. 3.

Shell white, regular, elongated, inequivalve, inequilateral; right or
upper valve entirely flat, with a plait or fold; much produced towards
the beak; hinge anomalous, formed by a transverse cardinal tooth on the
right valve, entering into a corresponding cavity on the left; ligament
internal, oblique, triangular, inserted in a pit rather deep, with edges
a little projecting on each valve; two rounded muscular impressions.


                              FAMILY VII.
                       LITHOPHAGI. Three genera.


                       1. Saxicava. Five species.

This genus is taken from the Mytilus, and, like the Pholas, possesses
the faculty of penetrating calcareous rocks, from which it cannot be
extracted without breaking the substance in which it is imbedded.

Shell bivalve, thick, covered with epidermis, rather irregular,
elongated, sub-cylindrical, obtuse at the two extremities; summits
little marked; hinge toothless, or with a very small rudimentary tooth;
ligament external, a little inflated.

                            Saxicava rugosa.
                            S. Gallicana.

Species transversely elongated.


                     3. Venerirupis. Seven species.

Another lithophagous shell, taken from the genus Venus, from which it is
distinguished by the different disposition of the teeth, having three
primary in one of the valves at least.

Shell more or less irregular, sub-trigonal, striated or radiated,
equivalve, inequilateral, the anterior side shorter and rounded, the
posterior sub-truncated; summits well marked; hinge sub-regular, more or
less dissimilar, formed by slender, narrow, cardinal teeth, variable in
number on each valve, sometimes two on the right and three on the left,
and sometimes three on both; these teeth are small, contiguous,
parallel, and but little, if at all, divergent exterior; very weak.

                              FAMILY VIII.
                         NYMPHACEA. Ten genera.

This family is divided into N. Solenaria and N. Tellinaria, from their
resemblance to the Solen and the Tellina.


                      N. SOLENARIA. Three genera.


                    1. Sanguinolaria. Four species.

This genus may be distinguished from the Solen by never having the
transverse oblong shape, or the edge of the valves parallel to the base.

                        Sanguinolaria occidens.
                        S. rosea.

                        S. rugosa.

_S. rosea._ The rosy Sanguinolaria.

Semi-orbicular, smooth, shining and convex; near the umbones of a
beautiful rose colour, which becomes paler as it descends; acute
transverse striæ.

_S. occidens._ The setting-sun Sanguinolaria. Pl. 7, fig. 4.

Oval, a little elongated, very compressed, slightly gaping, valves
elliptical, equally rounded at the two extremities, without mark of
posterior keel; summits slightly indicated; hinge formed by one or two
contiguous cardinal teeth on each valve; ligament projecting, convex;
margins not parallel.


                    2. Psammobia. Eighteen species.

Taken from the Tellina, which it much resembles in form, but from which
it differs by not having the irregular plait on the anterior part.

Shell ovate, transverse, slightly gaping; summits projecting; hinge
formed by two teeth on one valve, and only one inserted on the other.

                           Psammobia virgata.

                           P. Galathea.

_P. virgata._ The striped Psammobia. Pl. 7, fig. 1.

Species rather gaping, striated longitudinally, the teeth of the hinge
considerably effaced.

Oblong oval; white, radiated with crimson; finely striated transversely;
valves obliquely truncated.


                      3. Psammotæa. Seven species.

Of the same form as the Psammobia, but differing in the number of teeth,
as the left valve of the Psammotæa has only one tooth; sometimes one
valve is toothless, while the other has two teeth.

Shell transverse oval or oblong; gaping a little at the sides; one
primary tooth on each valve, though sometimes on only one of them;
ligament exterior, attached to callosities at the hinge, and without an
irregular plait.

                          Psammotæa violacea.
                          P. zonalis.

Transversely ovate-oblong, sub-ventricose; transversely striated; purple
radiations.


                       TELLINARIA. Seven genera.

The first five of these genera have one or two lateral teeth, the
remaining two have none.


              4. Tellina. The Tellen. Fifty-four species.

This genus differs but little from the Donax; its species are numerous,
especially in the seas of hot countries; they are found sunk deep in the
sand.

There are but few genera that can vie with the Tellina in beauty,
variety, or number; some are smooth and polished, some are remarkable
for their beautiful radiations, and others are covered with minute striæ
and undulations; occasionally the whole surface is covered with
imbrications or scales.

They are produced abundantly in almost every sea and in many rivers, but
the finest species are found in the pearl-fisheries of Ceylon.

The usual form of the Tellina is broad at one end and gradually tapering
towards the other. It derives its name from the Greek word τελειω, to
bring to a termination.

Shell of variable form, generally striated longitudinally and very
compressed; equivalve, more or less inequilateral; anterior side longer
and more rounded than the posterior; offers a flexuous plait or twist at
the inferior margin; summits little marked; hinge similar; one or two
cardinal teeth; two distant lateral teeth, with a pit at their base in
each valve; ligament external.

                            T. ostracea.

_T. radiata._ The radiated Tellen. Pl. 8, fig. 5.

Shell elongated; posterior side shorter and more narrow than the
anterior.

_T. foliacea._ The foliaceous Tellen.

valve are rows of serrated teeth, running from the apex to the margin.

_T. bimaculata._ The double-spotted Tellen.

Species orbicular, easily known by answering to its common name.

_T. fabula._ The false Tellen.

Shell very thin, pellucid, and oval; yellowish colour, darker towards
the umbo, which is nearly central, pointed and turned a little to one
side; anterior side slopes to an obtuse point; posterior side large and
rounded; hinge with three teeth in one valve and two in the other.

_T. scobinata._ The rasp Tellen.

Species oval or sub-orbicular, sub-equilateral.

_T. donacina._ The Donax-like Tellen. Pl. 9, fig. 5.

in one valve and one in the other; pale yellow, radiated longitudinally
with pink.

_T. depressa._ The depressed Tellen.

Oval, flat, pointed at the smaller end and slightly reflected; pale
yellowish colour, faintly striated concentrically; covered with a pale
brown epidermis.


                      5. Tellinides. One species.

Though this genus bears a great affinity to many others, it cannot be
united with any; having lateral teeth, it differs from the Psammobia; by
not having the valves twisted, it differs from the Tellina; the valves
closing, and having muscular impressions in the interior, render it
distinct from the Lucina.

Shell equilateral, rather elongated, almost without the flexuous plait;
two cardinal teeth diverging, and two remote lateral teeth, of which the
anterior is but little distant from the summit.

The only type and species of this genus.


                        6. Corbis. One species.

This genus was at first classed by Lamarck with the Lucina; but Cuvier,
having discovered that the organization of the animals differed, made
this a distinct genus, which was adopted by Lamarck.

Shell transverse, equivalve, no flexuosity; apices curved inward,
opposed to each other; two primary and two lateral teeth, the posterior
one nearest to the hinge; muscular impression simple, valves sometimes
convex, strongly ribbed transversely, striated longitudinally, margins
serrated and closely interlocking.

_C. fimbriata._ The fringed Corbis. Pl. 8, fig. 1.

Species white, rather thick, oval, a little elongated, almost
equilateral; the cardinal and the lateral teeth well marked; the
muscular impression anterior, rounded.


                       7. Lucina. Twenty species.

In the hinge and lateral teeth it much resembles the Tellina, but
differs from it in never being flexuous. This genus is more easily
characterized by the orbicular, compressed, general form of the shell,
than by the dental system, which is sometimes entirely effaced.

Shell compressed, regular, orbicular, sub-equilateral; summits small and
pointed, inclined anteriorly; hinge similar, but variable; two divergent
cardinal teeth, little marked, and sometimes entirely effaced; two
remote lateral teeth, with a pit at the base, sometimes obsolete;
posterior ligament more or less sunk; two widely-separated muscular
impressions, of which the anterior is narrow and long.

Species lenticular, striated concentrically; the teeth of the hinge
variable, and sometimes obsolete.

Orbicular, thin, convex, undulated with fine irregular striæ; exterior
pale yellow, interior white; margin glossy and plain.


            8. Donax. The Wedge Shell. Twenty-seven species.

The singularity of form that gave rise to its common name renders it
easily distinguished. It very much resembles a wedge, being very broad
and thick at one extremity, and gradually tapering towards the other.
They vary in colour, but the most general is purple radiated on a white
ground, diverging from the beak to the margin; many have an orange
tinge, and others a pink hue; the interior generally partakes of the
colour of the exterior. There are not, perhaps, two species that have
absolutely the same hinge.

The Donax is found buried deep in the sand of the seashore, with the
short side uppermost.

Shell sub-trigonal, greater in length than in height, equivalve, very
inequilateral; posterior side much shorter than the anterior; summits
almost vertical; hinge complex, similar; two cardinal teeth in one or
both valves; one or two remote lateral teeth on each valve; ligament
posterior, short, and inflated; two rounded muscular impressions.

Species oval, of which the posterior side is sub-truncated; with
decussated and muricated striæ.

_D. trunculus._ The common Donax.

Oblong, glossy, finely striated longitudinally, transversely banded and
radiated with purple; white, clouded with purple within; internal margin
of the valves distinctly dentated or crenulated.

Species of which the posterior side is truncated; furrowed from the
summit to the base.


                         9. Capsa. Two species.

This genus was separated by Lamarck from the Donax on account of the
peculiarity of the hinge.

                          Capsa lævigata.
                          Capsa Braziliensis.

_C. lævigata._ The smooth Capsa.

Triangular, sub-equilateral, obsoletely striated transversely; covered
with a greenish yellow epidermis; inside violet towards the umbones.

_C. Braziliensis._ The Brazilian Capsa. Pl. 8, fig. 7.

Shell elongated, covered with epidermis; equivalve, close; the cardinal
teeth reduced to one large sub-bifid tooth on the right valve, placing
itself between two very thin ones on the left; ligament external, on the
short side.


                       10. Crassina. One species.

Distinguished from the Crassatella by the position of the ligament, and
from the Venus by having only two teeth on each valve; one of them on
the left valve projects very slightly.

_C. Danmoniensis._ The Devonshire Crassina. Pl. 6, fig. 1.

Solid, thick, sub-orbicular, sub-equilateral; two very large divergent
teeth on one valve, and two very unequal ones on the other; regular
parallel grooves and ribs; covered with a yellowish epidermis; inside
white; margin broad and plain.


                               FAMILY IX.
                        CONCHACEA. Seven genera.

This family is divided into Conchæ fluviatiles, fresh-water shells, and
Conchæ marinæ, sea shells.


                     C. FLUVIATILES. Three genera.


                       1. Cyclas. Eleven species.

The shells of this genus are very small, and are found buried in the mud
of fresh waters; the apices or summits are never eroded, and some
species are so thin as to be transparent.

Shell covered with a brown epidermis, oval or sub-orbicular, regular,
equivalve, inequilateral; summits blunt, contiguous, or turned
anteriorly; hinge similar, complex, formed by a variable number of
cardinal teeth, and by two remote lateral teeth with a cavity at the
base; ligament exterior, posterior, and convex; two distant muscular
impressions, without posterior sinus.

                            Cyclas rivicola.
                            C. cornea.

_C. cornea._ The horny Cyclas. Pl. 9, fig. 7.

Species sub-orbicular, convex, thin, pellucid, with fine concentric
striæ; cardinal teeth a little variable, always very small, and
sometimes obsolete; summits not eroded, covered with a horn-coloured
epidermis; interior bluish white.


                        2. Cyrena. Ten species.

This genus of shells is found in rapid rivers and streams; it was
formerly classed with the Cyclas, from which, however, it greatly
differs in having three cardinal teeth on each valve, and also lateral
teeth. They are thick, solid shells, sometimes of a large size; the
apices always eroded or carious.

Shell rounded and trigonal, ventricose, inequilateral; hinge with three
teeth on each valve; two lateral teeth, one of which is near the primary
ones; ligament exterior, placed on the largest side; in some species the
lateral teeth are crenulated, in others they are entire.

                           Cyrena trigonella.
                           C. orientalis.

                           C. Ceylanico.

_C. fluminea._ The river Cyrena. Pl. 6, fig. 7.

Species sub-trigonal or elongated oval; summits decorticated, more
anterior; three cardinal teeth, of which the two posterior are forked;
exterior greenish brown, interior variegated with white and violet;
sulcated transversely.


                       3. Galathea. One species.

This beautiful shell is found in fresh waters, and is distinguished from
the Cyrena by the divergent form of the primary tooth.

_G. radiata._ The radiated Galathea. Pl. 6, fig. 8.

Shell equivalve, sub-trigonal, covered with a greenish epidermis,
beneath which the surface is of a milky white, highly polished, with
several violet or pale chestnut rays diverging from the apex to the
margin; primary teeth furrowed, two on the right valve joined at the
base, three on the other valve placed triangularly, the intermediate one
being advanced, separate, thick, and callous; the muscular impressions
are lateral, and appear double on each side.


                        C. MARINÆ. Four genera.


                        4. Cyprina. Two species.

This shell is generally large, resembling the Venus, from which it may
be distinguished by having on the front side one impressed lateral
tooth, which is sometimes obsolete; the nymphæ or callosities of the
hinge large, arched, and terminated near the apices by a cavity,
sometimes very deep.

De Blainville says that this genus is intermediary to the Cyclas and the
Venus, and contains but one living species; Lamarck makes two, though at
first he characterized eight.

                          Cyprina tennistria.
                          Cyprina Islandica.

_C. Islandica._ The Icelandic Cyprina. Pl. 9, fig. 2.

Shell thick, regular, heart-shaped, covered with dark brown epidermis;
white interior; sub-striated longitudinally; apices very strongly
recurved anteriorly, and often contiguous; hinge thick, sub-similar,
formed by three cardinal teeth but little convergent, and by one remote
posterior lateral tooth, sometimes obsolete; ligament very thick,
convex, fixed to large, arched, nymphal callosities, preceded by a
cavity more or less deep, hollowed immediately behind the summits;
muscular impressions subcircular and very distant.


                  5. Cytherea. Seventy-eight species.

This genus was taken from the Venus, and is easily defined as distinct
from it by having four primary teeth on one valve, and only three united
on the other, with an isolated cavity, oval and parallel to the margin;
the lateral teeth divergent to the summit. In some species the internal
margin is entire, having the anterior cardinal tooth with a striated
canal or uneven sides; in others the anterior cardinal tooth is entire,
without a striated canal; sometimes the internal margin is crenulated or
dentated.

Shell solid, regular, equivalve, inequilateral; apices equal, recurved,
and slightly projecting; four primary teeth on one valve, of which three
are divergent and approximating at the base, and one remote; three
primary divergent teeth on the other valve, with a distant cavity
parallel to the edge.

beneath which the shell is of a beautiful purple; radiated
longitudinally, faintly wrinkled transversely, anterior cardinal tooth
entire, and without a striated canal; apex turned sideways, with a
cordiform depression.

Species oval, thick, solid, more or less compressed, costated,
pectinated upon the edges.


                    6. Venus. Eighty-eight species.

This genus of shells is numerous and varied. It surpasses all bivalve
shells in beauty, and is in form very like the Cytherea, but easily
distinguished by the hinge, which almost invariably contains three
approximate teeth, and a lateral tooth diverging to the summit. The
internal margin of the valves is crenated or dentated, with or without
lamellar striæ.

The shells are of the most beautiful and lively tints; the exterior as
well as the interior colouring is of almost every possible shade and
hue. They are found buried a little below the surface on the sandy
shores of most parts of the world, particularly in warm climates.

Shell solid, thick, regular, perfectly equivalve and close, more or less
inequilateral; summits well marked, inclined anteriorly; hinge
sub-similar; the middle cardinal tooth forked, or three cardinal teeth
more or less contiguous and convergent towards the summit; ligament
thick, often arched, convex, and exterior; two distant muscular
impressions; cordiform depressions beneath the beaks.

                               FAMILY X.
                        CARDIACEA. Five genera.


        1. Cardium. Cockle, or Heart Shell. Forty-eight species.

This genus received its name from its resemblance to a heart (καρδια).
It is so well defined by Linnæus that no alteration was made by Lamarck,
except in making two divisions of them; the first distinguished by
having the anterior side as large or larger than the posterior, and no
distinct angle at the apex; the second by possessing carinated or
angular umbones, and the posterior side often much larger than the
anterior. These shells are found at a small depth in the sand on almost
every seashore.

Shell inflated, equivalve, sub-cordiform (when seen anteriorly),
generally costated from the summit to the circumference; summits very
evident; slightly recurved forward; hinge complex, similar, formed by
two oblique cardinal teeth, articulating with the corresponding teeth on
the other valve; two distant lateral teeth on each valve; ligament
dorsal, posterior, and very short.

                    2. Cardita. Twenty-one species.

Lamarck took this genus from the Chama on account of several
peculiarities in the shell as well as in the animal. It is not affixed
to other bodies by its lower valve, but, according to De Blainville,
lies exposed on the rocks. There is some difficulty in distinguishing
this genus from the Venericardia, without carefully examining the
position of the two teeth.

Shell regular, thick, solid, equivalve, more or less inequilateral;
summit dorsal, always very recurved anteriorly; hinge similar, formed by
two oblique teeth; one short cardinal placed beneath the umbo, the other
oblique, arched, marginal, and prolonged; ligament elongated,
sub-exterior, and inserted; two very distinct muscular impressions.

                           Cardita sulcata.
                           C. ajar.

                           C. lithophagella.

_C. crassicosta._ The thick-ribbed Cardita.

Species elongated, a little gaping at the inferior margin; ligament
concealed.

_C. sulcata._ The furrowed Cardita. Pl. 10, fig. 3.

Sub-cordiform or oval, more transverse than longitudinal; colour white,
tesselated with brown; posterior depression heart-shaped; longitudinal,
convex, transversely-striated ribs.


                     3. Cypricardia. Four species.

Distinguished from the Cardita by having three teeth beneath the apices,
and a callous lengthened tooth or ridge.

Shell obliquely elongated, equivalve, inequilateral; valves striated,
but never ribbed; hinge with three teeth beneath the umbo, and one
lateral elongated tooth.

                         Cypricardia Guinaica.
                         C. angulata.

Species elongated, very inequilateral; summit rounded and recurved
anteriorly; two short divergent cardinal teeth, besides a lamellous
tooth; ligament very long, projecting or not; yellowish white, covered
with decussated striæ.


                       4. Hiatella. Two species.

Established by Daudin; classed by Linnæus with the Solen, but Lamarck is
of opinion that it more nearly approximates the Cardita.

Shell thin, sub-rhomboidal, equivalve, very inequilateral, gaping at its
inferior margin and posterior extremity; the summit very anterior and
recurved in front; dorsal hinge formed by a single tooth on one valve
corresponding to a semicircular slope on the opposite valve, or by a
small tooth with a cardinal cavity in each valve; ligament probably
exterior and dorsal; muscular impressions unknown.

                           Hiatella Arctica.
                           Hiatella biaperta.

_H. Arctica._ The Arctic Hiatella.

Shell small, transversely oblong; apices truncated, with two divergent
spring ridges; a small tooth on each valve; cream colour, with
decussated striæ; inside pearly.

_H. biaperta._ The double-clefted Hiatella. Pl. 10, fig. 4.

Species that has only a single tooth on one valve; yellowish white.


                      5. Isocardia. Three species.

Taken from the Chama of Linnæus on account of a peculiarity in the shape
of the cardinal teeth, and the singular curvature of the umbones.

                            Isocardia cor.
                            I. semisulcata.
                            I. Moltkiana.

_I. cor._ The heart Isocardia. Pl. 12, fig. 4.

Shell free, regular, heart-shaped, equivalve, very inequilateral;
summits diverging, strongly recurved spirally, forward, and outward;
hinge dorsal, long, similar, formed by two flat cardinal teeth, with an
elongated lateral one behind the ligament, which is dorsal and exterior,
diverging towards the summits; muscular impressions very distinct and
rather small; slightly wrinkled longitudinally; exterior reddish
chestnut colour, interior white.

The Isocardia Moltkiana is a very rare shell, and the most elegant
species of this genus.


                               FAMILY XI.
                         ARCACEA. Four genera.


                       1. Cucullæa. One species.

Distinguished from the Arca by the muscular impression within, to one
side of which is an ear-shaped testaceous appendage; the shell is more
trapeziform, and the hinge by age becomes obsolete, giving the teeth a
more horizontal appearance.

Shell equivalve, inequilateral, trapeziform, heart-shaped; beaks
distant, and separated by the angular groove of the ligament, which is
altogether external; hinge linear, straight, with small transverse
teeth, having at its extremity from two to five parallel ribs; valves
marked with minute and strong longitudinal striæ, and sometimes one
valve overlaps; margins crenulated.

_C. auriculifera._ The eared Cucullæa. Pl. 10, fig. 1.

Species navicular or obliquely heart-shaped, with decussated striæ;
hinge completely straight, with two parallel ribs at each end, the
terminal teeth longer and more oblique than the others; exterior
chestnut colour, interior white, tinged with violet.


                2. Arca. The Ark. Thirty-seven species.

This genus is easily known by its resemblance to the hull of a ship; the
hinge is peculiar, being composed of numerous sharp teeth alternately
inserted between each other. The Arca of Linnæus was divided by Lamarck
into the four genera that compose this family, each possessing a strong
distinctive character. All the shells of this family are found in the
sea at a little distance from the shore; they are covered with a dark
greenish lamellar or velvet-like epidermis, frequently ending in a deep
fringe at the margin.

Shell a little varied in form, but most generally elongated, and more or
less oblique at the posterior extremity; sometimes very inequilateral;
summits more or less distant, and a little recurved forward; hinge
anomalous, straight, or a little curved; long, and formed by a line of
short vertical teeth decreasing from the extremities to the centre;

_A. Noæ._ Noah’s Ark. Pl. 10, fig. 5.

Species boat-shaped, oblong, striated transversely and ribbed
longitudinally; umbones remote and incurvated; margins entire and
gaping; hinge straight; whitish, with divergent zigzag chestnut stripes;
inside bluish white.

                   3. Pectunculus. Nineteen species.

This genus has the ligament partially inserted internally, and has no
exterior angular groove. The valves never gape, often have rayed
longitudinal ribs, are compressed, and the shell by age becomes thick
and ponderous, sometimes attaining a large size. The teeth in the hinge
are not so numerous as in the Arca and Cucullæa; the centre teeth appear
worn down.

Shell close, orbicular, doubly convex, equivalve, sub-equilateral;
summits almost vertical, and more or less distant; hinge formed on each
valve by a rather numerous series of small teeth, disposed in a curved
line, sometimes broken under the summit; ligament external and large.

Shell small, more or less thick, sub-triangular, equivalve,
inequilateral; summits contiguous and turned forward; hinge similar,
formed by a numerous series of very pointed teeth, pectinated and
disposed in a line interrupted under the summit; ligament internal,
short, inserted in a small oblique cavity in each valve; two muscular
impressions; valves more or less pearly within.

                           Nucula lanceolata.
                           N. rostrata.

                       1. Trigonia. One species.

Supposed to be in very deep places in the sea; it is a strong,
beautiful, pearly shell, sub-trigonal or sub-orbicular; thick, regular,
equivalve, inequilateral; summits slightly prominent, recurved,
anterodorsal; hinge complex, dorsal, dissimilar; two large oblong teeth
laterally compressed, joined angularly under the summit, strongly
furrowed on the right valve, penetrating into two excavations of the
same form, equally furrowed on the left valve; ligament exterior and
marginal; two distinct muscular impressions.

_T. pectinata._ The pectinated Trigonia. Pl. 11, fig. 4.

Species sub-orbicular, with radiated or divergent, prominent, and
somewhat scaly ribs; inside pearly; margin crenellated.


                       2. Castalia. One species.

This genus is found in fresh waters, and differs from the Trigonia in
the number and position of the lamellar teeth. The substance of the
shell is pearly.

Shell sub-trigonal, equivalve, inequilateral; umbones eroded, covered
with epidermis, and inflected anteriorly; hinge with two lamellar teeth,
transversely striated, one of them posterior, distant, and shortened,
the other anterior, lengthened, and lateral; ligament exterior.

_C. ambigua._ The ambiguous Castalia. Pl. 11, fig. 5.

Short, sub-trigonal; umbones truncated; longitudinally ribbed, with
distant transverse striæ; covered with epidermis, under which the shell
is of a pale chestnut brown, inside pearly; the lamellar and præ-apicial
teeth are well marked, more regular, and all striated perpendicular to
their length.


                              FAMILY XIII.
                         NAIADES. Four genera.


                     1. Unio. Forty-eight species.

The species of this genus become every day more numerous; they are found
in all countries, but particularly in North America. The Unio is a
fresh-water shell, and therefore, with great propriety, removed from the
Mya, which consists entirely of marine shells. The substance is pearly;
the exterior covered with a brown or green epidermis; the apices eroded.
They are found in the mud of rivers, with their apices downward; some
are slightly gaping, and some species produce fine pearls.

Shell generally very thick, pearly within, covered with epidermis;
summits eroded, dorsal, and sub-interior; besides a long lamellous tooth
under the ligament, the hinge is formed by a double precardinal tooth,
more or less compressed, and dentated irregularly on the left valve,
simple on the right valve; ligament external, dorsal, and post-apicial;
muscular impressions well marked.

often lamellar.


                         2. Hyria. Two species.

Easily distinguished from the Unio by a compound cardinal tooth, which
slopes in an inclined position towards the posterior side. They are more
found in lakes than in rivers.

Shell solid, pearly, equivalve, obliquely triangular, auriculated; base
truncated and straight; hinge with two projecting teeth; the cardinal
divided into numerous divergent parts; anterior ones smaller, the others
long and lamellar.

                           Hyria avicularis.
                           Hyria corrugata.

finely striated; interior pearly, exterior of a rich reddish
golden-yellow colour; covered with a greenish brown epidermis.


                     3. Anodonta. Fifteen species.

A fresh-water shell, found in ponds and lakes, difficult to be
distinguished from the Unio but by the hinge, which wants the cardinal
and lateral tooth, and merely presents a smooth internal rim round the
edge terminated by a sinus or notch, in which the anterior extremity of
the ligament is sunk; the substance is pearly, covered with a false
epidermis.

Shell ordinarily rather thin, regular, close, equivalve, inequilateral;
summit anterodorsal; hinge linear, without teeth; ligament external,
dorsal, and post-apicial; two well-marked muscular impressions.

                           Anodonta cygnæa.

or rounded, auriculated on both sides the summit.


                        4. Iridina. One species.

A very rare shell, separated from the Anodonta on account of the hinge
being attenuated in the middle, and having small tubercles distributed
along its length. The substance is thicker and more solid than the
Anodonta, and of a brilliant rose-coloured pearly hue; it is found in
the rivers of warm countries.

Shell equivalve, inequilateral, transverse, with small apices; recurved,
but nearly erect; not auriculated; hinge very long, linear, crenulated
through all its length; ligament external and marginal; two well-marked
muscular impressions.

_I. exotica._ The exotic Iridina.

                              FAMILY XIV.
                        CHAMACEA. Three genera.


                    1. Diceras. One fossil species.

Only found in a fossil state; distinguished from the Chama by the hinge,
which is dissimilar, formed by a large thick tooth, concave in the
greater valve; summits very projecting; almost regular spiral
contortions.

_D. arietina._ The ram’s-horn Diceras.

Shell irregular, inequivalve, inequilateral, somewhat heart-shaped, with
divergent beaks.


            2. Chama. The Clam or Gaper. Seventeen species.

In this genus are now comprehended only such as have a thick oblique
transverse tooth, resembling a lengthened callosity, generally
crenulated or grooved, fitting into a corresponding cavity in the lower
valve. The animals inhabiting these shells have the faculty of affixing
themselves to other bodies by the lower valve.

The Chama received its name from its gaping; it is found in most seas,
particularly in the Southern; sometimes its colours are elegantly
blended.

Shell irregular, adherent, inequivalve, inequilateral; summits more or
less twisted spirally, especially in the lower valve; some from left to
right, others from right to left; hinge dissimilar, large, formed by one
lamellous, arched, sub-crenulated, post-cardinal tooth, articulating
into a furrow of the same form; exterior, post-apicial, slightly
inserted; two large and rather distant muscular impressions.

dilated, waved foliations; striated obsoletely; exterior white, orange,
red, or yellow; interior white.

_C. arcinella._ The hedgehog Chama.

Species of which the summits twist from right to left; the pink-coloured
ones of this species are the most prized.


                       3. Etheria. Four species.

Distinguished from the Chama by the want of teeth in the hinge, and
being of a pearly substance. It is a rare shell, only found in deep
water, where it is attached to the rocks by the lower valve. Its
irregular form is perhaps occasioned by the lower valve adapting itself
to the form of the body to which it is affixed. Two species are
fluviatile and two marine.

Shell adhering, irregular, thick, pearly, inequivalve, inequilateral;
summits thick, little evident; hinge toothless, callous, thick,
irregular; longitudinal, sub-dorsal ligament, partly exterior and partly
penetrating into the shell; two oblong muscular impressions, one
inferior and anterior, the other superior and sub-posterior; with or
without an oblong incrusted callosity on the base of the valve.

                               FAMILY XV.
                        TRIDACNITES. Two genera.


               1. Tridacna. The Clam Shell. Six species.

The most ponderous shell known, sometimes measuring several feet in
length, and sometimes weighing five hundred pounds.

By Linnæus this genus was classed with the Chama, but the characteristic
distinctions are so great that they are easily known. The Chama is
irregular, has but one tooth, and is fastened to other substances by the
lower valve; the Tridacna is equivalve, has but two teeth, and is
affixed to other bodies by a byssus consisting of filiform tendons.

The animal inhabiting this shell is said to produce very fine pearls,
but there is no pearly appearance on the valves.

Shell thick, solid, varying in size; some are very small and some very
large; regular, triangular, more or less inequilateral; the summits
inclined backward; hinge dissimilar, entirely anterior to the summits;
one lamellous precardinal tooth, and two distant lateral teeth on the
left valve, corresponding to two lamellous precardinal teeth and one
remote lateral tooth in the right valve; ligament anterior, elongated;
one forked sub-median muscular impression, almost marginal and
oftentimes nearly obsolete; valves with broad, rounded longitudinal
ribs, armed with vaulted scales, more or less elevated; posterior slope
heart-shaped, and widely gaping.

                            Tridacna gigas.
                            T. elongata.
                            T. squamosa.
                            T. crocea.
                            T. mutica.
                            T. serrifera.

_T. gigas._ The giant Tridacna. Pl. 12, fig. 3.

Species of which the shell is sometimes very large, white, transversely
ovate or elongated; the anterior side longer than the posterior; broad
ribs covered with vaulted scales; when of a pink or orange colour,
greatly valued.


                       2. Hippopus. One species.

Similar to the Tridacna, but distinguished from it by having its
posterior slope closed with a dentated margin; its ribs are never arched
or vaulted, and its anterior side is shorter than the posterior side.

_H. maculatus._ The spotted Hippopus. Pl. 12, fig. 1.

Shell transversely ovate, ventricose, with scaly ribs; lunule,
heart-shaped, and oblique; margins deeply crenulated; reddish purple
spots.


                              FAMILY XVI.
                        MYTILACEA. Three genera.


              1. Mytilus. The Muscle. Thirty-five species.

As arranged by Lamarck, now comprises only such shells as are regular,
equivalve, and longitudinal; solid in substance, and attached to other
bodies by a short thick byssus.

In colour and appearance they greatly vary, some being smooth and
beautifully variegated with delicate colours, or radiated with purple
and white; some are coarsely ribbed or granulated, and have only one
colour, as black, blue, yellow, brown, or green; all are covered with an
epidermis, to which oftentimes the colour is confined.

Shell of a close texture, elongated, more or less oval, sometimes
sub-triangular, equivalve, summits anterior, more or less curved, a
little sloping inferiorly; hinge generally without teeth, or with two
very small rudimentary teeth; ligament dorsal, linear, sub-interior,
inserted in a long and narrow furrow; two muscular impressions, of which
the anterior is very small, with or without longitudinal grooves or
furrows.

                   2. Modiola. Twenty-three species.

Taken by Lamarck from the Mytilus, as it differs by being more
transverse than longitudinal, and the beaks, instead of being terminal,
are placed beneath the apex.

Shell smooth, sub-transverse, equivalve, regular, sub-triangular, the
posterior side short; summits almost lateral; hinge lateral and linear,
without teeth; ligament partly interior, placed in a marginal furrow;
one sub-lateral elongated muscular impression in each valve.

_M. sulcata._ The furrowed Modiola.

Species striated longitudinally.


               3. Pinna. The Wing Shell. Fifteen species.

This genus is the same as constituted by Linnæus; the shell is marine,
generally very brittle and fragile, in form resembling an acute angled
triangle; usually covered with longitudinal ribs and elevated transverse
striæ; generally horn coloured.

This genus is remarkable for the production of an abundant byssus of a
fine brown silky texture, which the Italians frequently fabricate into
articles of dress, equal in appearance to the finest silk.

The Pinnæ often grow to a large size; they are sometimes found standing
erect in the smooth-water bays, with the base of the shell uppermost,
but generally affixed by the byssus to rocks and other sub-marine
bodies. The filaments that compose the byssus are so tough and strong
that the shells are not easily detached.

Shell fibrous, fragile, regular, equivalve, longitudinal, triangular,
base gaping and as if truncated; summit pointed and straight; hinge
dorsal, longitudinal, linear, and without teeth; marginal ligament
occupying almost the whole of the dorsal edge of the shell; one very
broad muscular impression behind a trace of the anterior in the summit.

                             Pinna rudis.
                             P. flabellum.

Species gaping at the posterior extremity, which is as if truncated;
valves rather rounded at the upper end, and in the shape of an expanded
fan; light fawn colour.

_P. pectinata._ The pectinated Pinna. Pl. 13, fig. 1.

Thin, pellucid; longitudinally ribbed and spinous for half its width,
obliquely striated transversely on the other half.


                              FAMILY XVII.
                        MALLEACEA. Five genera.


                      1. Crenatula. Seven species.

There is one peculiar distinction between this genus and the Perna; the
hinge of the Crenatula is composed of slightly concave callous
crenulations, which receive the ligament; while in the Perna it consists
of parallel truncated linear teeth (or, rather, riblike joints),
corresponding and opposed to the opposite ones, the ligament being
inserted only in their interstices.

Shell thin, very delicate, irregular, valves flattened, foliaceous,
sub-rhomboidal, sub-equivalve; hinge longitudinal, dorsal, without
teeth; ligament sub-multiple, and inserted in a series of rounded
cavities corresponding with the dorsal margin; one sub-central muscular
impression.

                         Crenatula avicularis.
                         C. modiolaris.
                         C. nigrina.

                         C. mytiloides.
                         C. phasianoptera.

_C. avicularis._ The avicular Crenatula. Pl. 14, fig. 2.

Answers to the above description.

_C. mytiloides._ The muscle-shaped Crenatula.

Oblong, ovate, oblique; base acute; violet coloured, with obscure
radiations.


                         2. Perna. Ten species.

In speaking of the Crenatula, we gave the characteristic distinction,
which regarded it natural and expedient to make the Perna form a
different genus.

Shell irregular, very compressed, foliaceous, sub-equivalve, rather
variable form, gaping at the anterior part of the lower extremity;
summit very small, hinge straight, vertical, without teeth; ligament
multiple, and inserted in a series of longitudinal parallel furrows.

                            Perna ephippium.
                            P. obliqua.
                            P. isognomon.
                            P. avicularis.

                            P. nucleus.

_P. femoralis._ The femoral Perna. Pl. 14, fig. 1.

Species elongated, and with appendages like ears.

_P. vulsella._ The tweezer Perna.

Species elongated, without earlike appendages, or having very small
ones.

_P. ephippium._ The saddle Perna.

Species round, compressed, very pearly in the interior; very slightly,
if at all, auricled; margin acute; exterior purplish brown.


                  3. Malleus. The Hammer. Six species.

A shell of a singular form, resembling a pickaxe, found only in the
Indian and Australian Seas; there are two species, the white and the
black, both of which, when in fine preservation, are highly esteemed,
but the white is more rare and valuable.

Shell sub-nacreous, irregular, rugged, sub-equivalve, inequilateral,
generally auricled before and prolonged behind, so as to be in form like
a hammer; summit entirely anterior; between them and the inferior
auricle, an oblique cut or slope for the passage of the byssus; hinge
linear, elongated, without teeth; ligament simple, triangular, inserted
in a conical oblique cavity, partly exterior; one rather large
sub-central muscular impression.

                            Malleus albus.
                            M. vulgaris.

                            M. anatinus.
                            M. decurtatus.

_M. vulgaris._ The common Malleus. Pl. 14, fig. 4.

Species with two earlike appendages; trilobate, colour blackish brown.

_M. albus._ The white Malleus.

Species trilobate; base of the lateral lobe prolonged, without a sinus;
the base and the pit of the ligament not distinct; colour white, with
transverse undulations.

Species slightly auricled.

_M. normalis._ The square Malleus.

Species without earlike appendages.


                     4. Avicula. Thirteen species.

Remarkable for the form of its shell, which resembles, when partially
expanded, a bird flying.

Shell foliaceous or not, thin and very fragile, always pearly,
sub-equivalve; form sub-regular, but rather variable; summit anterior;
valves oblique, the left one with a little notch, through which the
byssus passes; sometimes unequally and obliquely auricled; hinge linear,
toothless, or with two small rudimentary teeth; ligament more or less
exterior, placed in a narrow groove, sometimes enlarged towards the
summit; one very large posterior muscular impression; and one very small
anterior.

                          Avicula macroptera.
                          A. lotorium.
                          A. semi-sagitta.
                          A. heteroptera.

                          A. crocea.
                          A. Tarentina.
                          A. Atlantica.
                          A. squamulosa.

                          A. physoides.
                          A. virens.

_A. macroptera._ The rounded Avicula. Pl. 14, fig. 3.

Species oval, oblique, the earlike appendages very developed, especially
the superior; one tooth at the hinge.

_A. Atlantica._ The Atlantic Avicula.

Obliquely curved, yellowish fawn colour, with dark reddish-brown stains;
interior pearly.


                      5. Meleagrina. Two species.

The form of the shell is orbicular and equivalve, without the elongated
transverse base on the cardinal tooth, and the sloping sides of the
opening for the passage of the byssus are perceptible on both valves;
these peculiarities distinguish it from the Avicula.

Shell sub-equivalve, rotundate, nearly square, externally squamose; the
inferior cardinal margin straight, not caudate anteriorly; a sinus at
the posterior base of the valves for the passage of the byssus; the left
valve being at this place narrow and channelled; hinge linear, without
teeth.

                       Meleagrina margaritifera.
                       Meleagrina albina.

_M. margaritifera._ The pearl-bearing Meleagrina, sometimes called the
mother-of-pearl oyster.

Species slightly oblique, somewhat square, pearly, very thick,
compressed; undulated and transversely striated, with a series of
lamellated longitudinal scales; exterior greenish, interior pearly. This
shell is celebrated for its irridescent colours, and is valued for the
beautiful and costly pearls it produces. These pearls are formed from a
deposition of the substance destined to line the shell upon sand or
other bodies, casually or purposely introduced within the mantle of the
animal; the shell itself is the mother-of-pearl used for inlaying, or
making various elegant trinkets.


                             FAMILY XVIII.
                       PECTINIDES. Seven genera.


              1. Pedum. The Shepherd’s Crook. One species.

The common name was given to this genus from the resemblance to a French
shepherd’s crook. The shell is of a regular form; its lower valve, in
which is a sinus for the byssus, is turned up at the edges, and the
upper valve falls within it.

Shell inequivalve, a little eared; apices unequal, distant, rounded,
little evident; hinge without teeth; ligament inserted in an oblique
groove, prolonged to the summit, and carried within in a kind of
spoonlike cavity.

_P. spondyloideum._ The spondylus-shaped Pedum. Pl. 15, fig. 5.

Ovate, wedge shaped, flat; superior valve with longitudinal striæ;
white, granulated, and rough; slightly tinged with purple near the beak.


                 2. Lima. The File Shell. Six species.

No sinus or notch; the valves, thick and gaping, form a lateral opening;
the ears are small, but distinct.

Shell oval, more or less oblique, almost equivalve, with small ears,
regularly gaping at the anterior part of the lower edge; summits
anterior and distant; hinge longitudinal, without teeth; ligament
rounded, almost exterior, inserted in a cavity of each valve; central
muscular impression divided into three very distinct parts.

                             Lima inflata.
                             L. squamosa.
                             L. glacialis.
                             L. annulata.
                             L. fragilis.
                             L. linguatula.

_L. squamosa._ The scaly Lima. Pl. 15, fig. 3.

Answers to the above description, with valves ventricose, armed with
vaulted scales.

_L. fragilis._ The fragile Lima.

Oblong ovate, very pellucid, delicately white, with longitudinal
distinct striæ; lower margin denticulated, closely interlocking when the
valves are closed.


              3. Pecten. The Scallop. Fifty-nine species.

The shells constituting this genus are found in all seas; they are well
known, and many of them are very beautiful.

The form is usually regular; their surface is adorned with elevated
divergent ribs, varying in number from five to thirty, proceeding from
the beaks and terminating at the margins in a scalloped outline.

Some are equivalve, others have one valve flat and the other convex; the
colours of the upper valve are brighter than those of the lower.

There is considerable variation in the size and form of the ears, which
in some species are equal or nearly so, but in others are unequal; some
are so small as to be nearly indistinct. The ribs are variously
diversified with beautiful colours and delicate checker-work; the
margins are mostly crenated, and oftentimes beautifully coloured.

These shells were formerly worn by Pilgrims on their hat or coat, as a
mark of having been to the holy shrine in Palestine.

Shell free, regular, thin, solid, auricled, equivalve, equilateral;
summits contiguous; hinge without teeth; a ligamental membrane through
all the length of the hinge, besides a short, thick ligament, almost
entirely internal, which fills a triangular cavity under the summits;
one sub-central muscular impression.

                           P. lividus.

_P. glaber._ The glabrous Scallop. Pl. 15, fig. 4.

Species of which the two valves are ribbed and almost equally convex,
the right a little less, and having its inferior ear less broad than the
left, so as to produce a kind of groove for the passage of the byssus.

_P. Jacobæus._ The scallop of St. James.

Species very inequivalve; the left valve being very flat, the right
convex; ears equal.

_P. pleuronectes._ The sole Scallop.

Species equivalve, not closing; surface smooth and ribbed within; one
valve perfectly white, the other of a brownish or reddish colour.


                  4. Plagiostoma. Ten fossil species.

Only known as fossils; probably introduced here by Lamarck to serve as a
connecting link for the genera Lima, Pecten, Spondylus, and Podopsis.

Shell rather thick, regular, free, sub-equivalve, sub-auriculated; the
two valves almost equally convex, both provided with a distinct summit,
recurved in the middle of a level surface, with a great triangular slope
in the middle; the cardinal base transverse, straight; hinge without
teeth; a conical cardinal pit situated below the beak, partly internal,
opening outward, and receiving the ligament.

_P. spinosa._ The thorny Plagiostoma.

Subarcuated, the umbo of one shell higher than that of the other, with
longitudinal ribs and remote concentric rings.


                      5. Plicatula. Five species.

Separated from the Spondylus of Linnæus on account of its distinct
structure. The ligament is altogether internal; it is without ears, and
the prolonged beak so conspicuous in that genus. The Plicatula has the
faculty of affixing itself to another body, so that many are found
grouped together in clusters. The valves are strongly plaited within and
without, closely interlocking with each other.

Shell solid, adhering, sub-irregular, without ears, inequivalve, pointed
at the summit, rounded and plaited behind; hinge with two strong teeth
in each valve, with a cavity between them, in which the ligament is
internally inserted.

                           Plicatula ramosa.
                           P. depressa.
                           P. cristata.
                           P. reniformis.
                           P. Australis.

_P. ramosa._ The branched Plicatula. Pl. 15, fig. 2.

Oblong, trigonal, very thick; strong longitudinal plaits; exterior
brown, with a yellow tinge, with reddish arrow-shaped markings; interior
white.


          6. Spondylus. The thorny Oyster. Twenty-one species.

The valves of this genus greatly resemble those of the common oyster,
but have ears, and are covered with long recurved or straight-pointed
spines.

The lower valve is much larger than the upper, and has foliaceous
laminæ, by which it is attached to the other substances. They are found
in all seas of hot countries, but particularly in the Indian; they
adhere to rocks, coral, &c., oftentimes in large groups.

The usual colours are red, purple, white, brown, or orange, several of
which are sometimes blended in the same shell.

Shell solid, adhering, sub-regular, more or less spined,
sub-auriculated, inequivalve; the right or inferior valve fixed, much
more excavated than the other, and having behind, at the summit, a
triangular face, which enlarges and elongates with age; hinge
longitudinal, provided in each valve with two strong teeth entering into
corresponding cavities; ligament short, almost medial, partly exterior;
one sub-dorsal, muscular impression.

                          Spondylus gædaropus.

_S. gædaropus._ The thorny red Spondylus. Pl. 15, fig. 1.

Upper valve red, under one white, with longitudinal striæ or ribs; rough
granulations, and somewhat tongue-shaped; rather short truncated spines.

_S. longispineus._ The long-spined Spondylus.

Thickly spined, longitudinally sulcated and ribbed; alternate spines
arcuated and tongue-shaped; valves of a reddish colour; umbones orange.


                    7. Podopsis. Two fossil species.

Only introduced here to fill up the family and keep up the chain of
connexion. It approximates the genus Gryphea.

Shell rather thick, sub-regular, symmetrical, equilateral, inequivalve,
adhering by the extremity of the shorter valve; the other terminated by
a summit pointed, a little recurved and medial; articulation very
angular, by means of two very distant condyles.


                              FAMILY XIX.
                         OSTRACEA. Six genera.


                        1. Gryphæa. One species.

This genus resembles the Ostrea, with which it was formerly classed, but
from which it is distinguished by the peculiar character of the lower
valve. It is very deep and carinated, with a summit terminating in a
long spirally recurved beak, slightly turned to one side; the edge sharp
and angular.

It is seldom, if ever, attached to other bodies. Shell more finely
lamellated than that of the oyster, free or slightly adherent,
sub-equilateral, very inequivalve; the lower valve very concave, with a
summit more or less recurved like a hook; the upper valve much smaller,
and formed like a lid; hinge without teeth; ligament inserted in an
oblong arched cavity; one single muscular impression on each valve.

_G. angulata._ The angulated Gryphæa. Pl. 16, fig. 2.

Oblong ovate, with three long longitudinal carinated ribs below; summit
of the inferior valve is subvolute. This is a rare shell.


              2. Ostrea. The Oyster. Forty-eight species.

As given by Lamarck, is a natural and well-defined family. It is too
well known to require description. It fixes itself to other bodies by
the laminæ of the whole surface of one valve, and generally remains
immoveable, exhibiting no other signs of life other than that of opening
its valves to receive nutriment.

Shell irregular, inequivalve, inequilateral, exterior roughly
foliaceous, interior somewhat pearly; the left or inferior valve larger,
deeper, and adhesive, its summit prolonging with age in a sort of heel,
the right or superior valve smaller, more or less in the form of a lid;
hinge without teeth; ligament short, sub-interior, inserted in an oblong
cardinal cavity, increasing with the summit; muscular impression single
and sub-central.

                            Ostrea edulis.

_O. edulis._ The eatable Oyster. Pl. 16, fig. 5.

Species orbicular, and not plaited; rugged, with undulated, imbricated
scales; one valve flat and the other convex; variable in size; outside
greenish brown, inside pearly white, sometimes with a bluish tinge.

_O. Virginica._ The Virginian Oyster.

Species longitudinal and not plaited.

_O. imbricata._ The imbricated Oyster.

Species orbicular and plaited.

_O. crista-galli._ The Cock’s-comb Oyster.

Species strongly plaited longitudinally.


                3. Vulsella. The Tweezers. Six species.

This genus has several characteristics which distinguish it from the
Ostrea; they are free; the valves and the apices are nearly equal, with
a projecting callosity on each valve, depressed underneath, and
obliquely arched for the reception of the ligament.

Shell sub-nacreous, sub-regular, sub-equivalve, inequilateral; upper
valve finely granulated, or striated longitudinally from the apex to the
margin; summits anterior, distant, recurved below; hinge without teeth;
ligament undivided, thick, inserted in a rounded cavity, made in a
slightly projecting callosity on each valve; muscular impression
sub-central, rather large, and two very small ones entirely anterior.

_V. lingulata._ The tongue-like Vulsella. Pl. 15, fig. 6.

Elongated, depressed, transversely striated; pale yellowish brown, with
longitudinal darker stripes.


          4. Placuna. The Chinese Window Shell. Three species.

This genus received its common name from the thin, transparent nature of
the valves of the shell, particularly of the species _placenta_, which
by the ingenious Chinese are often polished and used as a substitute for
window-glass.

The hinge of the shells of this genus is so peculiar as to make it
perfectly distinct; entirely interior, fastened by a ligament shaped
like a V on one of the valves.

Shell free, sub-irregular, very thin, almost entirely transparent, flat,
sub-equivalve, sub-equilateral, slightly auricled; hinge entirely
internal, formed on the superior less valve by two elongated, unequal,
oblique ribs converging at the summit, to the interior side of which a
ligament like the letter V is inserted in two equally converging, rather
deep cavities of the lower valve, which is more convex; one rather
small, sub-central muscular impression.

_P. placenta._ The glassy Placuna. Pl. 16, fig. 3.

Sub-orbicular, flat, white, and transparent; finely striated
longitudinally, slightly decussated.


               5. Anomia. The Antique Lamp. Six species.

When Linnæus formed this genus and named it Anomia, he probably did so
from its having no determinate character. Its common name was given it
by the fancied resemblance of some of its species to an antique lamp.
Like the oyster, they seldom leave their place; they are always affixed
to marine bodies by an osseous operculum, formed by the thick extremity
of the animal’s muscle. The lower valve is perforated and smaller,
conforming to the shape of the substance to which it is affixed.

Shell adhering, irregular, inequivalve, inequilateral, ostraceous;
inferior valve rather more flat than the superior, divided at the summit
into two sloping branches, whose approaching together forms a large oval
hole, through which protrudes a muscle, the extremity of which becomes
ossified and adheres to extraneous bodies; one sub-central muscular
impression divided into three.

                           Anomia ephippium.
                           A. patellaris.
                           A. cepa.
                           A. electrica.
                           A. pyriformis.
                           A. fornicata.
                           A. membranacea.
                           A. squamula.
                           A. lens.

_A. ephippium._ The Saddle Anomia. Pl. 16, fig. 1.

Shell sub-orbicular, irregularly wrinkled and waved; upper valve convex,
under flat and perforated at the hinge, through which passes the
ligament by which it is affixed to other bodies; inside pearly, and of
various changing colours, such as green, purple, violet, and yellow.


                   6. Crania. The Scull. One species.

So called from the appearance caused by three holes or cavities on the
surface of the lower valve.

Shell irregular, orbicular, inequivalve; the inferior valve almost flat,
and marked on the interior with four muscular impressions, sometimes
very deep, and of which the two sub-central are sufficiently connected
to form but one; the superior valve like a Patella, more or less convex,
with four very distinct muscular impressions, rather distant.

_C. personata._ The masked Crania. Pl. 16, fig. 4.

Orbicular; upper valve gibbous and conical, lower valve flat, with three
perforations.


                               FAMILY XX.
                       BRACHIOPODA. Three genera.


                       1. Orbicula. One species.

Greatly resembling a Patella, for which it is often mistaken on account
of the lower valve being very thin, flat, and adhering.

Shell sub-orbicular, very compressed, inequilateral, very inequivalve;
the inferior valve very thin, adherent, and imperforated; the superior
valve like a Patella, with a summit more or less inclined towards the
posterior side.

_O. Norwegica._ The Norwegian Orbicula. Pl. 17, fig. 4.

Upper valve in the form of a depressed cone, with a summit produced and
pointed.


                    2. Terebratula. Twelve species.

Taken from the Anomia, and with great propriety, as its characteristic
differences are very great; the perforation of the Anomia is always in
the smaller valve, which is attached to the larger by a cardinal
ligament, while in the Terebratula the perforation is always in the
larger valve, which is connected to the smaller by teeth at the hinge.
In some the valves are smooth, and in others grooved longitudinally.

Shell thin, equilateral, sub-triangular, inequivalve; one of the valves
larger and more convex than the other, prolonged behind by a sort of
heel, sometimes recurved, and pierced by a round hole at its extremity;
frequently sloped more or less by a cleft of variable form; the opposite
valve smaller, more flat, sometimes formed like a lid, having in the
interior a system of support variable in form and complication in every
true species; hinge limited, prominent, and formed by two articulating
surfaces of one valve placed between corresponding projections of the
other; a kind of tendinous ligament issuing from the sloping cleft of
the shell, by which it is attached to marine bodies.

Some genera of this family are without a testaceous covering, and are
mentioned only for the sake of preserving the family entire.


                1. Hyalæa. Venus’s Chariot. Two species.

This genus derives its common name from a fancied resemblance to a
miniature triumphal car.

                      2. Chitonellus. Two species.

Formerly classed with the Chiton; but as the testaceous plates of this
genus are never joined, the two may be easily distinguished.

Shell elongated, multivalve; alternate pieces generally longitudinal;
sides naked.

                        Chitonellus striatus.
                        Chitonellus larvæformis.

small, and almost entirely concealed under the skin; tufts hairy or
silky between the parts of the valves near the margin.


                        3. Chiton. Six species.

This genus was so called from the resemblance of its testaceous covering
to a coat of mail. The form of the Chiton is very similar to a
well-known insect called the woodlouse, found in decayed timber; it
generally adheres to rocks, or lies rolled up like a ball among seaweed
and stones. In length it seldom exceeds an inch, except in tropical
climates, where they are sometimes three or four inches long. In general
there are eight valves, the termination of which is surrounded by a
scaly or rough ligament, which enables the animal to expand or contract
its shell freely. It presents a great variety of colour; in general it
is dark brown, overcast with a shade of green, but some are beautifully
variegated with pink, yellow, blue, or red; interior green or whitish.

Shell more or less elongated, consisting of a longitudinal series of
eight very symmetrical calcareous pieces, more or less curved, and round
at both extremities; summit more or less marked, and when imbricated,
always from front to rear.

of the skin naked or hairy, but always provided with silky or hairy
tufts disposed in pairs between the junctions of the valve.

_C. spinosus._ The spiny Chiton. Pl. 1, fig. 4.

Shell beset with long, thin, curved, tubular, hairy, blackish spines.


     4. Patella. The Limpet or Dishlike Shell. Forty-five species.

The Patella of Linnæus was divided by Lamarck into several distinct
genera, and now comprehends only such shells as are of a conical form,
with an imperforated summit. The anterior is that part to which the
summit inclines, and is always more narrow than the posterior part.

It derives its name from its resemblance to a little dish; the colour
and structure are various; some are smooth, others granulated, and many
are covered with elevated tuberculated ribs. The exterior is sometimes
of a pale fawn colour, and the interior of a bright pink; some have a
silvery hue, but the more general colour is bluish white or light brown.

This genus of shells is very numerous in all seas, but chiefly in hot
countries, where they are found of a larger size; they generally adhere
by their base to rocks, stones, and marine substances, from which it is
difficult to detach them.

Shell oval or circular, sub-conic; summit right or more or less recurved
anteriorly; the cavity simple, entire, more or less deep; the margin
complete and entirely horizontal; a narrow muscular impression.

evidently inclined behind; aperture as large as the shell; the lateral
edges straight and parallel, the posterior rounded, the anterior sharp
and notched in the middle; muscular impression large, elongated oval,
slightly open in front.

                  1. Acera. Has no shell. One species.

                             Acera Carnosa.


                        2. Bullæa. One species.

Formerly classed with the Bulla, but separated from it on account of the
shell being entirely covered by the animal, and never externally
visible.

Shell oval, thin, fragile, more or less involuted on one side, rendering
the aperture more or less wide.

_B. aperta._ The open Bullæa. Pl. 17, fig. 5.

Shell interior and very incompletely involuted, without spire or
columella; sub-orbicular, white, transparent, faintly striated, and
slightly wrinkled; almost entirely open.


                 3. Bulla. The Bubble. Eleven species.

The great confusion that existed in this genus, as classed by Linnæus,
has been elucidated by the division and classification of Lamarck. This
genus derived its name from the resemblance which some of the smaller
species have to a bubble of water. Its shells are found in almost all
parts of the world.

Shell external, oval, involuted; aperture very large, open the whole
length of the shell, and generally wider at the base; outer edge sharp
and smooth; summit umbilicated.

                            Bulla lignaria.
                            B. ampulla.
                            B. striata.

                            B. cornea.
                            B. fragilis.
                            B. solida.

_B. aplustre._ The streamer-like Bulla. Pl. 17, fig. 7.

Species completely involute; the spire very distinct, visible, but not
projecting, with a kind of thickening at the anterior part of the
columellar edge.

_B. lignaria._ The woodlike Bulla.

Species sub-involute, no visible spire either within or without, but
narrowed towards the top when it is slightly umbilicated; yellowish
brown colour, with transverse pale striæ.

_B. hydatis._ The watery Bulla.

Species more solid, thicker, almost entirely involute; whorls of the
spire slightly visible in an umbilicus projecting interiorly from the
summit.

_B. naucum._ The sea-nut Bulla.

Species thin; the whorls of the spire visible externally, but without
projection, and with a suture as if caniculated without thickening at
the anterior part of the columellar edge.

_B. fragilis._ The fragile Bulla.

Species very thin, rather involute; the whorls of the spire distinct
within as without; the suture deep, angular, and cleft in a greater or
less part of its length.


                               FAMILY V.
                        APLYSIACEA. Two genera.


                       1. Aplysia. Three species.

This genus may almost be said to have no testaceous covering, as it
appears more like the element of a shell.

                           Aplysia depilans.
                           A. fasciata.
                           A. punctata.

_A. depilans._ The bald Aplysia.

Shell dorsal, semicircular, of a thin yellow cartilaginous substance.


                       2. Dolabella. Two species.

Closely allied to the Aplysia; it is a singularly formed shell,
difficult to describe, as it contains few of the characteristics which
distinguish other shells.

Shell rudimentary, entirely flat, sub-spiral, with a summit thick and
very callous.

                          Dolabella Rumphii.
                          Dolabella fragilis.

_D. Rumphii._ Rumphius’s Dolabella.

Base thick, callous, and sub-spiral; dilated above, thin, and
wedge-shaped.


                               FAMILY VI.
                        LIMACINEA. Five genera.


                1. Onchidium. Has no shell. Two species.

                      2. Parmacella. One species.

Lamarck has given a description of the animal of this genus, but only
mentions that the scutcheon contains a shell or solid crustaceous body.

                          Parmacella Olivieri.


                        3. Limax. Four species.

                      4. Testacella. One species.

Shell external, very small, ear-shaped; very depressed, summit inclined
posteriorly, not spiral; aperture oval, very large; the left edge sharp,
a little rolled inward, especially behind.

_T. Haliotidea._ The Haliotis-shaped Testacella. Pl. 17, fig. 6.

Answering to the above description; very thin, transparent, and
yellowish.


                        5. Vitrina. One species.

Shell proportionally very small, extremely thin, pellucid, almost
membranous, oval or sub-globular; spire very short, of which the last
whorl is very large; aperture large, semilunar; the edges sharp; the
left edge arched, and extending itself interiorly to the summit.

_V. pellucida._ The pellucid Vitrina. Pl. 17, fig. 3.

Extremely thin, pellucid, and glossy; depressed, spire very short;
aperture large and oval; colour pale yellowish green.


                              FAMILY VII.
                       COLIMACEA. Eleven genera.


          1. Helix. The Snail. One hundred and seven species.

According to the systematic arrangement of Lamarck, this genus now
consists of shells with peculiar characteristic distinctions.

By Linnæus, marine, land, and fresh-water shells were united in this
genus, and so confounded that the naturalist would often look in vain
for the distinguishing characters which would enable him to class and
determine the genus of the object under examination.

Notwithstanding the divisions of Lamarck, its species are numerous; the
shells are terrestrial, and found in all parts of the globe; some are
rare and beautiful.

The term Helix was given to this genus from the spiral form of the
shell.

Shell extremely variable in form, generally globular, sometimes
ventricose, conoid, never turriculated; summit constantly obtuse and
rounded; aperture generally of a medium size, but sometimes very large
or very small, always modified by the turn of the spire; oval,
semilunar, more wide than long, edges disunited, entering but very
little into the formation of the interior; the right lip or margin
thickened or reflected.

obtuse, and the last turn much greater than all the others taken
together; aperture oblong oval, the edge disunited; the right reflected
outward in adults; the columella smooth, with an inflection in the

                      8. Achatina. Twenty species.

This likewise is an elegant genus of shells, classed by Linnæus with the
Bulla. They are the largest land-shells known, and greatly resemble the
Bulimus, but never have their lips reflected or thickened. Sometimes the
last whorl is compressed and attenuated at the base, and sometimes
ventricose and not compressed.

Shell in form very variable, but generally sub-turriculated, ventricose,
striated longitudinally; the summit papillose; aperture a little
variable, but never thickened or reflected; the right edge always acute,
the columellar margin rather strongly hollowed, entirely formed by the
columella, of which the anterior extremity is constantly open and
truncated.

to the shape of an ear; many of the species are named from their
resemblance to the ears of particular quadrupeds. It is a land-shell,
found chiefly in the East and West India Islands.

Shell thick, solid, more or less smooth, oval, oblong, spire short and
obtuse; aperture entire, oblong, enlarged, ear-shaped, much contracted
behind; edges disunited; right lip sometimes thick and outwardly
reflected; the left or columella with one or more teeth or thick callous
plaits.

beneath; no columella; the columellar edge replaced by a kind of sharp
partition, which covers part of the aperture, with a sinus at its left
extremity; muscular impression shaped like a horseshoe, open in front
and interrupted behind; thin, calcareous operculum, with a subulate,
lateral tooth adhering to the posterior margin; the other edges sharp.

Formerly classed with the Helix, which it somewhat resembles in form,
but properly separated, as it differs in every other respect.

It is a singular marine shell, often found in great numbers floating on
the surface of the sea, suspended by a vesicular appendage, which stains
the hand of a purple colour.

its short spiral columella.

Shell oval, more or less thick, very depressed, spiral short, little
elevated, lateral; aperture very extended, entire, the left edge
reflected and sharp; two lateral muscular impressions very disunited.

To be easily distinguished from the Stomatia by not having a transversal
rib.

Shell very depressed, orbicular or oblong; imperforate; interior pearly;
aperture very large, oval, longer than wide; the right edge effuse,
dilated, and open; summit pointed and incurved.

and sharp, colour white, interior pearly.


              4. Haliotis. The Ear Shell. Fifteen species.

This genus is very beautiful, and derived its common name from its
resemblance to the human ear. The exterior is generally tuberculated and
loaded with marine substances, which gives it a rough and uncouth
appearance, but the interior forms a splendid contrast by its natural
iridescence. Each shell is furnished with a row of orifices near the
margin, varying in number from eight upward; of these from three to
seven are generally open, and the others close. These holes are made by
the animal as it increases the size of the shell, to admit the passage
of a short syphon.

They are found adhering to rocks like the Patella, and are detached with
great difficulty.

Shell ear-shaped, pearly, recurving, very depressed, more or less oval,
with spire very small, very low, almost posterior and lateral; aperture
as large as the shell, with margins continued; the right thin and sharp,
the left flat, enlarged, and sharp; a series of holes, complete or
incomplete, parallel to the left margin; one large oval muscular
impression.

                       1. Vermetus. One species.

Resembling in appearance the shell of a Serpula; but the organization of
the animal caused this to be made a distinct genus.

Its shells are usually found grouped together or intertwined with each
other, and are very remarkable for being attached to marine bodies by
the attenuated and pointed extremity of the spire.

Shell conical, tubular, thin, involute spirally, more or less close,
with whorls almost completely disunited; free or adherent by
intertwining; aperture straight, circular, with edges sharp and
complete; several partitions not perforated towards the summit;
operculum horny and complete.

_V. lumbricales._ The wormlike Vermetus. Pl. 23, fig. 3.

A flexuous shell, with a spiral, acute tip, very much resembling a
corkscrew; colour reddish brown, sometimes clouded with a darker shade.


                      2. Scalaria. Seven species.

A marine shell, with a circular aperture like the Cyclostoma, but easily
distinguished by its turreted form; longitudinal, elevated ribs, never
connected together, rather oblique, and sharp; the shape of the shell is
elegant, being a spiral cone, formed by gibbous whorls, unconnected by a
columella, gradually increasing from the apex to the base. The colour is
generally yellowish or brownish white. When perfect and of good size,
they are of great value and highly prized.

Shell sub-turreted, the whorls of the spire more or less pressed and
garnished with interrupted longitudinal ribs, formed by the successive
preservation of the reflected margin of the aperture, which is small,
perfectly round, with edges united, thickened, and outwardly reflected;
operculum horny and thin.

                           Scalaria pretiosa.
                           S. lamellosa.

                           S. raricosta.

_S. pretiosa._ The precious Scalaria, more commonly called the Wentle
Trap, or Winding Staircase. Pl. 23, fig. 1.

This shell has its spiral whorls separate, and appears like an
attenuated tube evolved round a cone; spire detached, with a deep
umbilicus; volutions connected by longitudinal ribs; body extremely
ventricose; colour cream yellow.

_S. communis._ The common Scalaria, or false Wentle Trap.

More taper and elongated than the S. pretiosa. It has no umbilicus, and
the whorls are closely united.


                     3. Delphinula. Three species.

A marine shell, which, like the Scalaria, has a round aperture, but its
solidity and pearly substance distinguishes it from the Cyclostoma,
which is terrestrial.

Shell thick, pearly in the interior, sub-discoid or conical; the spiral
whorls sometimes detached, rounded, spiny, with a large umbilicus;
aperture round or multrigonal, not modified; edges perfectly united with
a small spire, tuberculated exteriorly.

                         Delphinula laciniata.
                         D. distorta.
                         D. turbinopsis.

                      1. Solarium. Seven species.

Some shells of this genus are highly valued for their beauty and rarity.

Shell orbicular, involuted almost in the same plane; Planorbis-shaped;
the spire of the right side very depressed; umbilicus large and conical,
with edges denticulated or not at the entrance; aperture not modified by
the last whorl of the spire, which is entirely flat; no columella.

bands on the sutures of the volutions.

_S. variegatum._ The variegated Solarium.

Species sub-carinated, aperture sub-orbicular.


             2. Trochus. The Top Shell. Sixty-nine species.

This genus derived its name from its resemblance to a top.

The shells are marine, found in almost all parts of the world; some are
smooth, but the greater number are covered, with knobs, spines,
tuberculations, or undulations.

The long spines on the margin of the T. Solaris are placed at regular
distances, and resemble the rays of the sun. Many, when decorticated,
look like mother-of-pearl; others have a splendid metallic lustre. The
T. agglutinans possesses the faculty of covering itself with extraneous
substances, such as stones, corals, fragments of shells, &c. Of this
species there are two kinds, which, though conchologically known only by
one name, are familiarly known by two; the Conchologist and the
Mineralogist; the former so called from being loaded with shells, and
the latter with stones, &c. Sometimes the Conchologist is loaded with
corals only, and then is called the Zoologist.

Shell thick, generally pearly, shaped like a top, spire sometimes
depressed, sometimes elevated and pointed at the summit, sharp or
carinated at its circumference, umbilicated or not; aperture depressed,
angular or sub-angular, sometimes heart-shaped, with edges disunited;
the right sharp; the columella arched, twisted, and often projecting
forward; operculum horny, thin, with numerous spiral whorls, narrow, and
increasing a little from the centre to the circumference.

and slightly depressed, and from the latter by the toothlike projecting
angle which the truncated columella occasions at the base of the
aperture.

Shell ovate or conoid, aperture round and entire, with an operculum;
outer lip disunited from the body at the top; columella arched and
truncated at the base.

Species sub-globular, umbilicated, spiral whorls rounded; the columella
terminated by a tooth.

_M. fragarioides._ The strawberry-shaped Monodonta.

Species more or less globular, of which the columella, almost straight,
offers but a little obstacle to its junction with the margin.


            4. Turbo. The Turban Shell. Thirty-four species.

Distinguished from the Monodonta by never having the columella truncated
at the base; and from the Trochus by being solid, with the whorls
constantly convex and never flattened. Like the Trochus, when
decorticated, the Turbo exhibits splendid pearly, gold, or silver
irridescent colours.

Shell thick, pearly in the interior; depressed, conical, or
sub-turreted; umbilicated or not, little or not carinated at its
circumference; aperture round or little depressed; the middle of the
external edge not bent, but sometimes hollowed or sloped in some part;
the edges rarely joined by a callosity; the columella arched, rarely
twisted, and not truncated at the base; operculum calcareous or horny;
the spire visible externally in the latter and interiorly in the former;
the exterior often thickened and curved.

possess a very distinctive character, that of a slightly projecting
angle running along the columella.

Shell rather thick, oval, smooth, without epidermis, spire pointed;
aperture oval, larger in front, with disunited edges; the right sharp;
the columella uniting itself a little with the left edge, and offering

                   1. Cerithium. Thirty-six species.

A beautiful and numerous genus of turreted shells, with an expanded
outer lip and short beak; the greater part are marine; many are found at
the mouths of rivers, and a few in lakes, though none can properly be
called river shells. In appearance they are like an elongated pyramidal
cone, and the spire is at least two thirds the length of the shell. The
exterior is seldom smooth, but striated, tuberculated, granulated, or
spinous.

Shell more or less turreted, generally tuberculated; aperture small,
oval, oblique; the columellar edge hollowed, callous; the right edge
sharp, and dilating a little with age; operculum horny, oval, rounded,
sub-spiral, and striated.

                     8. Struthiolaria. Two species.

The shells of this genus are marine, inhabited by mollusca, that, by
frequently moving in and out of the shell while wandering on the shore
in search of food, produce singular callosities on the two edges of the
aperture. They generally resemble the Murex and Buccinum, but are
distinguished by a thickened marginal lip on the right side.

Shell ovate, spire produced; aperture sinuous, terminated at the base by
a very short canal; straight, and without a notch; columellar edge
callous and effuse; right edge with a thickened varix.

                        Struthiolaria nodulosa.
                        Struthiolaria crenulata.

_S. nodulosa._ The nodulous Struthiolaria. Pl. 25, fig 1.

nodulous; cream-coloured, with undulated, brownish-yellow longitudinal
lines; interior of lip yellowish.


                     9. Ranella. Fourteen species.

This genus of shells has two rows of varices or thickened bands,
arranged on either side in rows, so that it forms a distinct division
between the Struthiolaria and the Murex.

Shell oval, as if depressed by the preservation of each side of a
longitudinal thickened band; aperture oval, almost symmetrical by the
excavation of the columellar edge, terminating anteriorly by a short
canal, often a little sloping; a sinus at the posterior junction of the
two edges.

lip internally crenated; acute, short, distinct muricated tubercles;
fawn coloured.


            10. Murex. The Trumpet Shell. Sixty-six species.

Though so greatly divided by Lamarck, this is a beautiful and numerous
genus, comprehending only such shells as have three or more varices on
each whorl.

These varices show the number of times the animal has increased the size
of its shell, and what proportion is added at each increase.

The shells are generally irregular in form, arising from their surfaces
being usually armed with spines, knobs, striæ, or foliations.

Shell generally oval; the spire always but little elevated, armed with
longitudinal transverse varices or thickened bands; aperture small; very
oval and symmetrical by the excavation of the left edge, formed by a
plate applied on the columella, terminated anteriorly by a middling
sized canal, sometimes very long and close; the right edge more or less
adorned with varices; operculum horny, oval, complete, almost circular,
with sub-concentric partitions; summit terminal.

                    11. Triton. Thirty-one species.

In this genus the varices are in longitudinal rows or series, but
alternating, few in number, sometimes only one on each whorl. They are
never spinous or foliated, though frequently plaited or tuberculated.

The Triton variegatus type of this genus is one of the largest spiral
shells.

Shell oval, with spire and canal straight, middling, generally rough,
garnished with varices, rare, scattered, and preserved in longitudinal
rows; aperture sub-oval, elongated, terminated by a short, open canal;
the columellar edge less hollowed than the right, and covered with a
callosity; operculum horny, oval, rounded, and rather large.

                              FAMILY XVII.
                          ALATA. Three genera.


                     1. Rostellaria. Three species.

Lamarck formed this genus from the Strombus of Linnæus on account of
having a sinus in the lower part of the right margin contiguous to the
canal. The beak is generally curved, and short in comparison to the
length of the spire, but sometimes it is straight, and equal in length
to the other part of the shell.

The R. rectirostris is one of the most rare shells known.

Shell sub-depressed, turreted, with spire produced and pointed; aperture
oval by the excavation of the columellar edge; the right margin dilating
by age, and having a sinus contiguous to the pointed canal which
terminates the shell.

                       Rostellaria curvirostris.
                       R. rectirostris.
                       R. pes-Pelicani.

_R. curvirostris._ The curved beak Rostellaria. Pl. 27, fig. 2.

Species with the right edge digitated.

_R. pes-Pelicani._ The Pelican’s foot Rostellaria.

Species turreted, with four digitations on the right edge; body and
volutions ribbed longitudinally and crowned with papillæ; flesh-coloured
or white.


                     2. Pteroceras. Seven species.

Formed from the Strombus, being distinct from it by not having the canal
at the base shortened or truncated. It greatly resembles the
Rostellaria, but the sinus of the right margin is distant from the body.
From its digitation or long recurved claws it has often been called the
Spider Shell.

Shell oblong-ovate, ventricose, canal elongated, attenuated, and often
closed; right margin dilating by age into an expanded, digitated wing,
attached to and covering a short spire, with a sinus in the lower part
not contiguous to the body.

                          Pteroceras truncata.
                          P. lambis.
                          P. millepeda.
                          P. pseudoscorpio.
                          P. scorpio.
                          P. aurantia.
                          P. chiragra.

_P. chiragra._ The Devil’s Claw. Pl. 28, fig. 3.

Tuberculated, with six digitated, canaliculated rays, closed in the
adult shell; outer lip internally striated.

_P. scorpio._ The Scorpion Pteroceras.

Species with digitations on the external edge, varying in number from
six to ten.


            3. Strombus. The Wing Shell. Thirty-two species.

As now defined and characterized by Lamarck, is easily distinguished by
not having the winged aperture on the right side dentated or digitated,
and the sinus therein always separated from the canal.

In some species the exterior is variously striated, smooth, wrinkled
longitudinally, or tuberculated; the interior presents vivid and
beautiful colours.

These shells frequently attain a large size and great solidity.

Shell thick, sub-involute, diconic, or ventricose, terminated like a
cone before and behind; aperture very long, narrow, terminated
anteriorly by a canal more or less elongated, recurved; the edges
parallel; the external dilating with age, offering behind a gutter at
its attachment to the spire, and before a sinus more posterior than the
canal, through which passes the head of the animal; operculum horny,
long, and narrow, with elements as if imbricated; the summit terminal.

                             FAMILY XVIII.
                      PURPURIFERA. Eleven genera.


                      1. Cassidaria. Five species.

Marine shell, sometimes confounded with the Cassis, but distinguished by
the canal which terminates the aperture being ascendant, very little
arched, and not suddenly recurved.

Shell sub-globular, ventricose, tuberculated, or fluted; spire short and
pointed; aperture long, oval, sub-canaliculated anteriorly; the right
edge effuse and folded back; the columella covered over with a broad,
smooth callosity, uniting behind to the right edge; operculum horny.

Species ovate, grooved transversely, volutions convex; apex with one
tubercle; tawny colour.


           2. Cassis. The Helmet Shell. Twenty-five species.

This genus was formed from the Buccinum, from which it is easily
distinguished; the latter having only a notch at the base, and the
Cassis with a canal abruptly turned towards the back of the shell.

Shell inflated oval, sub-involute, spire very little projecting;
aperture long, oval, sometimes very narrow, terminated anteriorly by a
very short canal, sloped and recurved obliquely towards the back; the
right edge more or less concave, reflected backward, and often dentated
within; the columella covered with a large callosity, denticulated or
wrinkled in all its length; operculum horny.

                       3. Ricinula. Nine species.

Shell oval or sub-globular, thick, armed with points or tubercles, with
a depressed spire; aperture narrow, elongated, notched, sometimes
canaliculated anteriorly, and digitated externally; the left edge more
or less callous, sometimes denticulated; operculum horny, oval,
transverse, with elements slightly imbricated.

Species canaliculated; two long palmated digits at the side of the
aperture.


                       4. Purpura. Fifty species.

This genus has its name from the purple liquid produced by the animal,
from which the ancients extracted the Tyrian purple dye. This is the
last genus that presents the appearance of a canal at the base of the
aperture, and therefore rightly precedes the remaining genera of this
family, all of which are without a canal.

Shell oval, thick, generally tuberculated; spire short; the last whorl
much greater than all the others united; aperture oval, greatly dilated,
terminated anteriorly by a canal short, oblique, and notched at the
extremity; the columellar edge almost straight, covered with a callosity
pointed anteriorly; operculum horny, flat, almost semicircular, with
transverse striæ slightly marked; the summit behind.

Transversely sulcated and striated between the ridges; colour
burnt-umber, ridges yellowish, with dark brown spots; upper ridge and
the superior edges of the volutions mucronate; interior sulcated and
striated.

_P. lapillus._ The common Purpura.

Species small, white, sometimes banded with yellow or brown, with a
scaly surface.


                5. Monoceros. The Unicorn. Five species.

Derived its name from the long, conical-pointed, somewhat recurved tooth
in the outer lip, by which alone it can well be distinguished from the
Purpura; and with this characteristic difference the description of the
shell of the Purpura will answer for this genus.

                         Monoceros cingulatum.
                         M. imbricatum.

                         M. glabratum.
                         M. crassilabrum.

_M. cingulatum._ The belted Monoceras.

Cylindrical, columella not smooth, but irregularly plaited or wrinkled,
and the tooth does not extend within the interior of the whorls as in
the other species, but appears affixed only to the edge of the lip;
volutions flattened in their upper edges; transverse spiral brown bands.


                      6. Concholepas. One species.

Formerly considered a Patella, but distinct from it on account of having
an operculum. It is particularly distinguished by having two teeth at
the base of the right side.

Shell wide, rough, oval, spire very short, not projecting; aperture very
large, oval, effuse, sloped anteriorly; the edges united; the right or
external very thick, dentated; the two teeth which limit the slope are a
little larger than the others; muscular impression visible, and almost
in form of a horseshoe; operculum horny and rudimentary.

_C. Peruvianus._ The Peruvian Concholepas. Pl. 28, fig. 1.

The type of this genus; exterior dark brown, interior white.


                7. Harpa. The Harp Shell. Eight species.

This genus of shells is truly beautiful; it was classed by Linnæus with
the Buccinum, but Lamarck considered that they were, for their beauty,
worthy of forming a genus by themselves.

Shell oval, inflated, rather thin, with longitudinal parallel ribs,
formed by the preservation of the thickening of the right margin; the
spire very short, pointed, the last whorl much longer than all the
others together; aperture large, ovate, widely notched anteriorly; the
right edge much excavated and thickened outwardly; the columella smooth,
and terminated in a point anteriorly.

                           Harpa imperialis.
                           H. ventricosa.

                           H. striata.

_H. imperialis._ The imperial Harp.

Species in which the number of ribs far exceeds that of any other, and
occasions it often to be called the many-ridged harp; a small spiral
keel round the summit. A rare and valuable species.

_H. nobilis._ The noble Harp. Pl. 29, fig. 2.

A regular species.

_H. rosea._ The roseate Harp.

Oblong-ovate; flesh coloured, with roseate interrupted bands; ribs
remote; columella of a fine rosy hue.


                8. Dolium. The Tun Shell. Seven species.

The shells of this genus are generally large, thin, and globose, with a
wide aperture, and toothed or crenated outer lip; they have a brittle
and light structure, and although some of them grow to a very large
size, they retain their characteristic fragility and thinness.

Shell sub-globular, very ventricose, thin, encircled by decurrent
flutings; the spire very short; the last turn much larger than all the
others together; aperture oblong, very large, by the great excavation of
the right edge, which is crenated through all its length; columella
twisted; operculum unknown.

                             Dolium galea.
                             D. olearium.

Species sub-umbilicated, ovate-oblong, thin, thickly ribbed, and convex;
colour reddish brown, clouded and spotted with white.

_D. galea._ The brown Tun.

Species not umbilicated; sometimes exceeds ten inches in diameter.


              9. Buccinum. The Whelk. Fifty-eight species.

Notwithstanding the divisions of the Linnæan Buccinum into so many
different genera, it still presents a great variety and diversity of
species.

Shell slightly covered with epidermis, oval, elongated; the spire
middling elevated; aperture oblong, oval, notched, and sometimes
sub-canaliculated anteriorly; the right edge thick, not reflected;
columella simple and swelled at the upper part; operculum horny,
complete, oval, with sub-concentric elements; the summit slightly marked
and marginal.

               2. Mitra. The Mitre Shell. Eighty species.

A numerous and elegant genus of shells, separated by Lamarck from the
Voluta on account of possessing several strong distinctive characters.
The spire is always pointed, and the columellar plaits, diminishing in
size, are always transverse and parallel to each other.

The exterior is sometimes most beautifully marked with transverse
grooves, striæ, punctures, or granulations; the colour of almost every
hue.

Shell turreted, sub-fusiform, and oval; the spire always pointed at the
summit; the aperture small, triangular, wider and strongly notched
anteriorly; the external edge sharp, almost straight, always longer than
the columella, which is formed by a very thin callosity, and marked with
oblique parallel plaits, of which those anterior are the shortest.

              3. Voluta. The Volute or Wreath. 44 species.

This genus, as established by Linnæus, included shells of different
families, promiscuously blended together, rendering it difficult to
determine satisfactorily respecting shells under examination. As
arranged and classified by Lamarck, it is still a numerous and beautiful
genus, containing some of the most rare and costly shells, particularly
V. Junonia or Peacock Volute, of which very few are known. They vary
considerably in size; some are very minute, and others large; they are
found chiefly in the seas of the torrid zone or southern hemisphere.

Shell oval, more or less ventricose; the first whorls of the spire
mamillose; aperture in general much more long than wide, strongly and
obliquely notched anteriorly; the right edge a little reflected, entire;
the columellar edge excavated, and adorned with great plaits, more or
less oblique, and a little variable in number with age.

                         CONVOLUTA. Six genera.


                     1. Ovula. The Egg. 12 species.

This is the first genus of Lamarck’s arrangement of convoluted shells;
it is nearly allied to the Cypræa, but easily distinguished from it by
the want of spire, and by not having teeth on the columellar lip; the
right lip is reflected inwardly, sometimes wrinkled and sometimes
smooth.

Shell oblong, convex, resembling the Cypræa in form, with the two
extremities of the aperture notched, and more or less prolonged like a
tube; the left margin dentated.

increases with age. One of the most rare shells of this genus.

_O. oviformis._ The egg-shaped Ovula. Pl. 34, fig. 1.

Species ovate, much inflated, ventricose in the centre, very glossy and
white; right edge dentated, the tube of each extremity very prominent;

body of the shell encircled by a blunt keel.

_O. verrucosa._ The warty Ovula. Pl. 34, fig. 3.

Species in which the right end is dentated, with a notch and a knob
above at each extremity.


                   2. Cypræa. The Cowrie. 68 species.

This genus derived its name from the Cyprian goddess, on account of the
beauty of its polished shells. They are generally smooth, of great
brilliancy of colour, and elegantly marked with dots, zigzag lines,
undulations, or stripes, and covered with an enamel-like glaze. They are
found buried in the sand at the bottom of the sea, and are covered by
the animal with a thin membrane, which preserves the polish and prevents
other testaceous bodies from adhering to them. This membrane consists of
two parts, and arises on both sides of the shell in the form of wings,
furnishing the testaceous and colouring matter; in some species they do
not quite meet on the back of the shell, and the uncovered space is
marked by a coloured dorsal line; when these membranous wings overlap
each other, this line is nearly obsolete.

These shells often differ much with age; at first in thickness, then
because the edges are thin, sharp, hardly dentated, unless internally;
and, lastly, sometimes in the outline; this is because the two lobes of
the mantle, by turning over the primitive shell during the creeping of
the animal, deposite new calcareous matter. De Blainville cannot admit
the hypothesis of Bruguiere, that these animals can completely abandon
their shell to form a new one.

Shell, when full grown and mature, is solid, oval, convex, very smooth,
involute; the spire entirely posterior, very small, often concealed by a
calcareous layer deposited by the lobes of the mantle, leaving in some
species a small cavity like an umbilicus; aperture longitudinal, very
narrow, slightly curved, as long as the shell, with edges internally
dentated, and notched at each extremity.

Shell, when young and immature, is very thin, the edges of the aperture
not dentated; the right margin sharp and not reflected.

An intermediate genus between the Terebellum and the Oliva;
distinguished from the former by a callous oblique band at the base of
the columella; and from the latter by not having the spiral whorls
separated by a groove.

Shell smooth, oval, oblong, pointed behind, enlarged and truncated
before; the columella covered anteriorly by a callous oblique band; the
right lip obtuse.

Species with spire nearly obsolete; shell chestnut colour, with white
bands; varix of the columella reddish and somewhat striated.


                5. Oliva. The Olive. Sixty-two species.

An oval, involuted, internal shell, distinguished from the Ancillaria by
a narrow canal continued from its upper angle around the sutures of the
spiral whorls. It was formerly classed with the Voluta, which genus has
not the canal, so that they cannot be mistaken for each other. There is
a callosity uniting with the spiral canal, and another at the base of
the columella.

Shell thick, solid, smooth, oval, elongated, sub-cylindrical; the spiral
whorls very small, separated by a canal; aperture long, narrow; the
columellar edge reflected anteriorly by a callosity, and striated
obliquely through all its length. The shells are generally clouded or
covered with waved lines of a brownish colour, more or less dark.

        6. Conus. The Cone. One hundred and eighty-one species.

A genus valued on account of the beauty, symmetry, and variety of its
species; some of its shells are very rare and remarkable for their
richness of colouring; some are coronated, and others have a plain
spire. They are all covered with an epidermis, beneath which is
generally a smooth surface, with sometimes a high polish; a few are
granulated and tuberculated. They are found in great abundance in the
seas of warm climates.

Shell conic, covered with a membranous periosteum, thick, solid,
involuted; the summit of the cone anterior; the spire little or not at
all projecting; aperture longitudinal, very narrow, turning towards its
anterior extremity; the external edge straight, with oblique plaits in
its anterior part; operculum very small and horny, sub-spiral, with
summit terminal.

                        NAUTILACEA. Two genera.


                        1. Spirula. One species.

An involute, symmetrical, discoid shell, whose whorls do not touch each
other; the septa or partitions are brilliant pearl, concave externally,
pierced by a tube called the siphon or siphuncle, placed close to the
inner edge of the aperture; covered with a thin epidermis.

_S. Peronii._ Peron’s Spirula. Pl. 36, fig. 2.

Answers to the above description; colour yellowish white.


                       2. Nautilus. Two species.

compressed, umbilicated or not, but never papillose; the septa simple,
transverse, not visible externally, the last deeply sunk and perforated
by a siphon running through them all; edges entire.

The N. Pompilius, when dissected, displays its beautiful pearly
chambers; fine specimens are often converted into drinking-cups by the
Orientals, who sometimes remove the outer coating, so that its whole
appearance is pearly.

The Nautilis varies in size; some are microscopic; and although they
have received different names, and on account of the animal have been
made to form different genera, it was deemed unnecessary to treat of
them here.

             1. Argonauta. The Paper Sailor. Three species.

The shells of this genus are remarkable for their fragility, delicacy,
and elegance; they resemble a scroll, ornamented with various
canaliculated grooves from the summit to the margin, which is
bicarinated. The colour is usually bluish, but the keel is of a darker
hue; they vary greatly in size.

Shell navicular, symmetrical, very thin, compressed, bicarinated,
sub-involuted longitudinally in the same plane; aperture very large,
entire, symmetrical, square in front, slightly modified by the turn of
the summit, and provided on each side with an earlike appendage, with
thick and smooth edges; lips sharp.

                            Argonauta argo.
                            A. tuberculosa.
                            A. nitida.

_A. argo._ The Portuguese man-of-war. Pl. 35, fig. 1.

Characterized above; shell whitish, fragile, keel rather narrow, with
sharp-pointed tuberculations; sides striated transversely, wrinkled
longitudinally.

_A. tuberculosa._ The tuberculated Argonaut. Pl. 35, fig. 2.

Species more convex at the sides, with nodulous elevations; keel
broader, points more obtuse.


           2. Carinaria. The glassy Nautilus. Three species.

In form and texture greatly resembling the Argonauta, but distinguished
by only having one keel on the whole length of the back.

Shell symmetrical, carinated or not, very thin, slightly compressed,
without spire, but with the summit slightly recurved posteriorly;
aperture oval and very entire.

                           Carinaria vitrea.
                           C. fragilis.
                           C. cymbium.

_C. vitrea._ The glassy Carinaria.

Species very rare and beautiful, thin, papyraceous, very fragile and
semitransparent; a serrated keel rises up its front, and the sides are
decorated with ribs parallel to the base.

_C. fragilis._ The fragile Carinaria.

Species smaller, very thin, striated longitudinally, diverging from the
summit to the margin; no keel.

_C. cymbium._ The minute Carinaria.

Species not larger than a grain of sand.
